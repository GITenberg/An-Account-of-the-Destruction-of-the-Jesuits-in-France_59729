<p class="drop-cap noindent">PERMIT,
Sir, an unknown,
but zealous, citizen, an
impartial historian of the Jesuits,
to pay public homage to
that truely philosophical patriotism
which you have displayed
in this affair. In exciting
against the society the zeal of
the magistrates, you have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
neglected to fix their enlightened
attention on all those men,
who may have with this alien
society any marks of resemblance,
and who, arrayed in
black, gray, or white, may acknowledge
like it, in the very
bosom of France, another country,
and another sovereign.</p>

<p>You have shewn no less
lights in making known to the
sage Depositaries of the laws,
all the Men of the party, whoever
they be, all the fanaticks,
whatever livery they wear, whether
they invoke <i>Francis of
Paris</i>, or <i>Francis of Borgia</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
whether they maintain <i>predeterminating
decrees, or congruous
assistances</i>.</p>

<p>If the author of this writing
had been able to ask you your
opinions, his work would, without
doubt, have gained greatly
by it. May you, such as it is,
grant it your suffrage, and receive
it as a slender mark of
the acknowledgement which
religion, the state,  philosophy,
and letters owe to you.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">THE
different pieces which
have been published on the
affair of the Jesuits (if we except
therefrom the requisitories of the
magistrates) breathe an animosity or
fanaticism in those who have undertaken
either to defend or attack the
society. We may say of these historians,
what Tacitus said of the historians
of his time: <i>Neutris cura posteritatis,
inter infensos vel obnoxios</i>:
“None of them were influenced by
any regard for posterity, being
themselves among the exasperated
or the obnoxious.” As the author
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
of the following writing professes a
pretty great indifference for quarrels
of this sort, he has had no violence
to do himself in order to tell the
truth (so far at least as he has been
able to come at the knowledge of it)
with respect to the causes and the
circumstances of this singular event:
if he has sometimes told it with
energy, he flatters himself at least
that he has delivered it without bitterness,
and he hopes that thus his
work will not displease those, who
like him are detached from any spirit
of party or interest. He has even
waited, before he published this
writing, till peoples' minds should
be no longer heated, in regard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
the matter which is the object of it;
he will lose thereby, without doubt,
some readers, but the truth will gain
by it, or at least be no loser.</p>

<p>The facts which are related here,
are, for the most part, very well
known in France: they are less so
to foreigners, for whom we have
proposed to write as well as for the
French. The reflexions which have
been to this historical account, may
be useful to both, and perhaps still
more to the French than to foreigners.</p>

<p class="drop-cap noindent">THE middle of the century,
in which we live, appears
destined to form an æra, not
only in the history of the human
mind, by the revolution which seems
to be preparing itself in our opinions,
but also in the history of states and
empires, by the extraordinary events
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of which we have successively been
witnesses. In less than eight years
we have seen the earth shaken, swallow
up a part of Portugal, Spain,
Africa, and Hungary, and terrify by
its shocks several other nations; a
war kindled from Lisbon to Petersbourg,
for some almost uncultivated
tracts in North-America; the system
of Europe changing suddenly its appearance
at the end of two centuries
by the strict and unhoped-for union
of the houses of France and Austria;
the consequences of that union, all
contrary to what it was natural to
have expected from it; the king of
Prussia withstanding alone five formidable
powers leagued against him,
and issuing from the bosom of the
storm victorious and covered with
glory; an emperor cast headlong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
from his throne; the king of Portugal
assassinated; France terrifyed at a
like attempt, and trembling for a life
the most precious; lastly, the Jesuits,
those men who were thought so powerful,
so firmly established, so redoubtable,
driven from the former
of these two kingdoms, and destroyed
in the second. This last event,
which is, for certain, neither the
most melancholy, nor the greatest of
those which we have just recapitulated,
is perhaps neither the least
surprising, nor the least susceptible
of reflexions. It is for philosophers
to see it such as it is, to shew it such
as it is to posterity, to make known
to the sages of all nations, how passion
and hatred have, without knowing
it, assisted reason and justice in
this unexpected catastrophe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to explain myself with
impartiality on the destruction of the
Jesuits in France, the object of this
treatise, we must begin very far
back, and reascend to the very origin
of this famous society, place in
one point of view the obstacles
which had been opposed to it, the
progresses which it has made, the
blows which it has given and received;
lastly, the causes apparent and
secret, which brought it to the brink
of the precipice, and which have
terminated by throwing it from
thence.</p>

<p>It is somewhat above two hundred
years since the society of Jesuits took
birth. Its founder was a Spanish
gentleman, who having had his brain
heated by romances of chevalry,
and afterwards by books of devotion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
took it into his head to be the Don
Quixote of the Virgin<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, to go and
preach to infidels the christian religion
which he knew nothing of, and
to associate himself for that purpose
with those adventurers who should
think proper to join him.</p>

<p>It will be thought astonishing,
without doubt, that an order, become
so powerful and so celebrated,
should have for its founder such a
man. This founder was however
wise enough to decline entering
into the order of Theatins, which a
cardinal, who some years after became
pope, had just established a
little before the Jesuits began to appear.
Ignatius, in spite of all the
opposition which his society experienced
at its birth, chose rather to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the legislator of an institution than to
subject himself to laws which were not
of his making. It seems as if he foresaw,
from that very time, the future
grandeur of his order, and the small
figure the other would make, though
destined to be in our times the cradle
of a pious prelate, raised from
the bosom of that order (by an impenetrable
Providence) to the first
dignities of the state and of the
church<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Ignatius had also the wit to perceive,
that a society which made
particular profession of devotion to
the holy see, would find infallible
support from the head of the Roman
church, and by these means from
the catholic princes, its dear and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
faithful sons; and that thus this
society would triumph at length over
the transitory obstacles which it might
meet with at its origin. It was in
this view that he gave to it those famous
constitutions, since perfected,
and always on the same plan, by
two successors very superior to Ignatius,
the two generals Lainez and
Aquiviva, so celebrated in the annals
of the Jesuits: the latter especially,
intriguing, adroit, and full of great
views, was on all these accounts very
proper for the government of an ambitious
society: to him it is indebted,
more than to any other, for those
regulations so well contrived and so
wise, that we may style them the
master-piece of the industry of human
nature in point of policy, and
which have contributed, during two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
hundred years, to the aggrandizement
and glory of this order. These
regulations, it is true, have ended in
being the cause or the motive of the
destruction of the Jesuits in France;
but such is the fate of all human
grandeur and power, it is in their
very nature to grow worse and become
extinct when they have arrived
at a certain degree of greatness and
lustre. The empire of the Assyrians,
that of the Persians, the Roman empire
itself, have disappeared, precisely
for this very reason, because they
were become too large and too powerful.
These examples ought to
console the Jesuits, if it be possible
for Jesuitical pride to be consoled.</p>

<p>We cannot better compare this
society, every where surrounded with
enemies, and every where triumphant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
for the space of two centuries,
than to the marshes of Holland,
cultivated by obstinate labour, besieged
by the sea, which threatens
every instant to swallow them up,
and perpetually opposing their dikes
to that destructive element. Let
these dikes be pierced but in one
single place, Holland will be laid
under water after so many ages of
labour and of vigilance. This is
what has happened to the society;
its enemies have at last found
out the weak part, and pierced its
dike; yet those who had raised
it with so much care and patience,
those who had afterwards
watched so long over its preservation,
those who have cultivated, with
so much success, the soil which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
protected by this dike, merit nevertheless
commendation on that account.</p>

<p>Scarce had the company of Jesus
(for that is the name which it
had taken), begun to shew itself in
France, when it met with numberless
difficulties in establishing itself
there. The universities especially
made the greatest efforts to expel
these new comers; it is difficult to
decide, whether this opposition does
honour or discredit to the Jesuits
who experienced it. They gave
themselves out for the instructors of
youth gratis; they counted already
amongst them some learned and famous
men, superior perhaps to those
of whom the universities could boast:
interest and vanity might therefore
be sufficient motives to their adversaries,
at least in these first moments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to seek to exclude them. We may
recollect the like opposition which
the Mendicant orders underwent
from these very universities when
they wanted to introduce themselves
there; opposition founded on pretty
nearly the same motives, and which
ceased not but by the state into which
these orders are fallen, now become
incapable of exciting envy.</p>

<p>On the other side, it is very probable
that the society, proud of that support
which it found amidst so many
storms, furnished arms to its adversaries
by braving them; it seemed to
shew itself, from this time, with that
spirit of invasion which it has but
too much displayed since, but which
it has carefully covered at all times
with the mask of religion, and
of zeal for the salvation of souls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
This desire of extending itself, and
of domineering, appeared already on
all sides: the society insinuated itself
into the confidence of several sovereigns;
it caballed at the courts of
some others; it rendered itself formidable
to the bishops, by the
dependance which it affected on
the court of Rome alone; in short,
the more it aggrandized itself, the
more it seemed to justify, by its credit
and its intrigues, the rancour of
its enemies against it. To govern
the universe, not by force, but by
religion, such appeared to have been
the device of this society from its
origin; a device which it has made appear
further to proportion as its existence
and its authority gained strength.</p>

<p>Never did it lose sight, either of
this object, or of the means (as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
smooth as efficacious) which it was
to employ in order to succeed in it.
It is perhaps the only one of all the
societies, as the house of Austria is
the only one of all the powers of
Europe, which has observed an uniform
and constant policy; an inestimable
advantage to societies and sovereign
houses. Individuals only pass
away, and are subject in that short
space to a small circle of events,
which by no means permit them
to have any immutable system. Bodies
and great houses subsist for a
long time; and if they pursue always
the same projects, the scene of the
world, which, changes perpetually,
brings on at last, soon or late, circumstances
favourable to their views.
We must, when once we have declared
ourselves their enemy, either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
annihilate them entirely, or end in
being their victim; so long as they
have one gasp remaining, they cease
not to be formidable. “You have
drawn the sword against the Jesuits,”
said a man of wit to a philosopher;
“well, throw the scabbard into the
fire.” But individuals, how numerous
and animated soever they be,
have very little force against a body:
accordingly the Jesuits so decryed, so
attacked, so detested, would subsist
perhaps still with more lustre than
ever, if they had not had for irreconcileable
enemies other bodies still subsisting
as well as them, and as constantly
taken up with the project of
exterminating them, as they have
been with that of aggrandizing
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The manner in which this society
established itself in those places
where it found the least resistance,
discovers very plainly the project
which we have attributed to them,
<i>of governing mankind</i>, and of making
religion subservient to that design.</p>

<p>It is thus that the Jesuits have acquired
in Paraguai a monarchical
authority, founded, it is said, on
persuasion alone, and, on the lenity of
their government: sovereigns in that
vast country, they render happy, it is assured,
the people there who obey them,
and whom they have at last effectually
subjected to them without employing
violence. The care with which
they exclude strangers, prevents our
knowing the particulars of this singular
administration; but the little
which has been discovered of it, speaks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
its praise, and would render it perhaps
to be desired, if the relations be faithful,
that many other barbarous countries,
where the people are oppressed and
unhappy, had had, as well as Paraguai,
Jesuits for apostles and masters.
If they had found in Europe as few
obstacles to their domination, as in
that vast country of America, it is
to be believed that they would rule
there at this day with the same empire:
France, and the states into
which philosophy has penetrated for
the happiness of mankind, would
without doubt have lost greatly thereby;
but some other nations perhaps
would not have been more to be
pityed for it. The people know but
one thing only, the wants of nature,
and the necessity of satisfying them;
the moment they are by their situation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
sheltered from misery and suffering,
they are content and happy:
liberty is a good which is not made
for them, of which they know not
the advantage, and which they possess
not but to abuse it to their own prejudice;
they are children who fall
down and hurt themselves the moment
they are left to go alone, and
who get up again only to beat their
nurse; they must be well fed, kept
employed without crushing them, and
led without suffering them to see too
plainly their chains. “This (say they)
is what the Jesuits do in Paraguai;
this probably is what they would
have done every where else, if the
world had been disposed to permit
them.” But in Europe, where they
had already so many masters, they did
not think proper to suffer any new ones:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
this resistance, tho’ so natural, irritated
the Jesuits, and rendered them wicked:
they made those nations, which
refused their yoke, feel all the evils
which those nations endeavoured to
inflict on them: useful and respectable
in Paraguai, where they found
only docility and gentleness, they became
dangerous and turbulent in Europe,
where they met with dispositions
a little different; and it is not without
reason it has been said of them,
that seeing they did so much good in
a corner of America, and so much
ill elsewhere, it was necessary therefore
to send them all to the only place
where they were not hurtful, and
to purge the rest of the earth of
them.</p>

<p>Let us return to France, or rather
to the history of the establishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of the society in that kingdom.
Already had the Jesuits, supported
by the protection of the popes and
by that of kings, succeeded, in spite
of the opposition of the universities,
to obtain very great advantages, to
found several houses, to raise at length
in Paris itself a college, which was
looked upon by the others with envy.
The establishment of this college had
undergone several assaults at different
periods: at first Stephen Pasquier, so
well known for his satyrical talents,
and several years after Anthony Arnauld,
father of the doctor, had
successively pronounced against the
Jesuits those famous pleadings, in
which a few truths are found joined
to much declamation. The society,
victorious in these pleadings, had obtained
by patent the liberty of continuing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
its lessons; the university of
Paris was obliged to put up with it,
and thought itself still very happy in
not being constrained to admit into
its bosom those ambitious and factious
men, who would soon have possessed
themselves of the power: perhaps also
they escaped this yoke, only because
the Jesuits disdained to impose it on
them: probably they thought themselves
sufficiently strong to raise with
success altar against altar; and their
vanity, flattered with making a party
by themselves, nourished from that
time the hope which it has since but
too well realized, of taking away
from the universities the education of
the most brilliant of the nobility
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>In the midst of this war of the
universities and the parliaments against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the Jesuits, the assassination of
Henry IV. by John Chatel, a scholar
of those fathers, was, as it were, the
signal of a new storm again them,
and made that thunder burst which
had long rolled over their heads.
The Jesuit Guignard, being convicted
of having composed, in the time
of the League, writings favourable to
regicide, and of having kept them
after the amnesty, perished by the
last torture; and the parliaments
which long since saw with an evil
eye those usurpers, and who sought
only a favourable occasion to get rid
of them, banished them from the kingdom,
as a “detestable and diabolical
society, the corrupters of youth,
and enemies of the king and of the
state:” these were the words of the
arrêt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>It is unhappily too certain (and
the history of those dreadful times
furnishes melancholy proofs of it)
that the maxims which they reproached
Guignard and the Jesuits
with, respecting the murder of kings,
were at that time those of all the
other religious orders, and of almost
all the ecclesiastics. Henry III. had
been assassinated by a fanatic of the
order of Jacobins; their prior Bourgoin
had just been broke upon the
wheel for that doctrine; a Carthusian,
named Ouin, had attempted the
life of Henry IV. This abominable
doctrine was that of the chiefs of
the League, among whom were reckoned
priests and bishops; it was also,
if we may venture to say it, that of
a great part of the nation, whom
fanaticism had rendered weak and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
furious. The crime of the society
was then that of many others. But
the rancour of the court of Rome
against Henry IV. the particular profession
which the Jesuits made of
devotion to that ambitious court;
lastly, the confidence which the king
had shewn towards them, in permitting
them to instruct youth; all
these motives, strengthened by the just
hatred which their ambition had excited,
made them deemed with reason
so much the more dangerous and more
criminal. Never have the Jacobins
been reproached with a Bourgoin and
Clement, assassins of their fraternity,
as the Jesuits have been reproached
with their scholar Chatel, and Guignard
their fellow: the reason is, that
the Jacobins are little dreaded, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
that the Jesuits were both feared and
odious.</p>

<p>In this their almost general disaster,
two parliaments had spared
them, those of Bourdeaux and Toulouse:
moreover, in banishing them
the rest of the kingdom, they had
neither alienated nor confiscated their
effects; the magistrates who had proscribed
them, had committed that
great mistake; those fathers, who
had still a corner in France to take
shelter in, made use of the little
breath which remained to them, in
preparing for their resurrection;
they joined to their intrigues, within
the kingdom, the support of several
sovereigns, and especially of
the court of Rome, which Henry IV.
feared to displease; and in spite of
the just remonstrances of the parliaments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
they obtained their return a
few years after they had been banished.
Henry IV. did much more
for them; whether it was that they
had found means to render themselves
agreeable to that prince, or
that he hoped to find in them more
facility in reconciling with his amours
the new religion which he professed;
or whether, lastly, which is most
probable, that great and unfortunate
king, having been so often assassinated,
and being still in danger of it,
feared and wanted to shew respect
for these foxes who were accused of
having tigers at their command, he
gave them in France considerable
establishments; among others the
magnificent college of la Flêche,
whither he was desirous that his
heart should be carried after his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
death; lastly, as if to interest them
more particularly in his preservation,
notwithstanding the reports which
prevailed against them, he took a
Jesuit for confessor. It is pretended
that he acted thus, in order to have,
in his very court and about his person,
an hostage who should be answerable
to him for that suspected
and dangerous society: it is added,
that the Jesuits had been recalled on
the very condition of giving this
hostage: if the thing be true, it must
be confessed that they were able, like
dexterous men, to make subservient
to their grandeur a law humiliating
in itself, and to avail themselves skilfully,
for the augmentation of their
credit, of the distrust and dread
which they had inspired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Louis XIII., who reigned after
Henry IV. or rather cardinal Richelieu,
who reigned under his name,
continued to favour the Jesuits: he
thought their zeal and their regular
conduct would serve at once as an example
and curb to the clergy; and
that the permission of teaching, which
had been granted them, and of which
they acquitted themselves with success,
would be to the universities an
object of emulation.</p>

<p>This great minister was not deceived.
It cannot be denied that
the Jesuits, and especially those of
France, have produced a great number
of useful works for facilitating
to young people the study of letters;
works, by which the universities
themselves have profited, so as to
produce, in their turn, similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
works, and perhaps better still: the
one and the other are known; and
the impartial public has given them
the favourable reception they merited.</p>

<p>Let us add (for we must be just)
that no religious society, without exception,
can boast so great a number
of men famous in the sciences and in
letters. The Mendicants, even at the
time of their greatest lustre, were but
schoolmen, the Benedictines only compilers,
the other monks mere blockheads<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.
The Jesuits exercised themselves
with success in every kind,
eloquence, history, antiquities, geometry,
literature both profound and
agreeable: there is hardly any class
of writers in which they count not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
men of the first merit: they have
even had good French writers; an
advantage of which no other order
can boast; for this reason, that in
order to write well in one’s own
language, it is necessary to keep company
with people of fashion, and that
the Jesuits, by the nature of their
functions, have been more dispersed
throughout the world than others.</p>

<p>It is assured that the late cardinal
Passionei, who detested these fathers,
(for which he might have good reasons)
pushed his hatred against them
so far, as not to admit into his fine
and numerous library any writer of
the society. I regret this, for the
sake both of the library and of the
master; the one lost a number of
good books by it; and the other, so
philosophical, as we are assured, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
other respects, was not at all so on
this occasion. If any thing can console
the Jesuits, it is that the same
cardinal, so sworn an enemy of all
their works, had the misfortune to
countenance and extol the rhapsodies
of that same Abraham Chaumeix,
whose very name now is become ridiculous,
and who is at present turned
down to his proper place, after having
been quoted and celebrated as a kind
of father of the church<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>The society owes to the form of
its institution (so decried in other respects)
this variety of talents which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
distinguish it. They reject no sort
of abilities, and require no other
condition, in order to be admitted
among its members, but a capacity
of being useful. To engage our liberty,
we must pay every where, even
among the Mendicants. The Jesuits
know nothing of this paltry interest;
they receive with pleasure and gratuitously
every person from whom they
hope to draw any good; nobody is
useless among them; of those from
whom they expect the least, they make,
according to their own expression,
<i>missionaries</i> for the villages, or <i>martyrs</i>
for the Indies. They have not even
disdained very great personages, little
worthy of the titles which they bore
when they made themselves Jesuits,
as a Charles of Lorrain, and several
others: their names have served at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
least as a decoration to the order, if
they were good for nothing else:
we may call them the <i>honoraries</i> of
the society.</p>

<p>Two other reasons seem to have
contributed to give the Jesuits, above
all the other orders, the advantage of
a greater number of men estimable for
their talents and their works: the
first is the duration of their noviciate,
and the law which permits them not
to bind themselves by the last vows
before the age of thirty-three. The
superiours have the more time to know
their subjects, to judge of them, and
to direct them towards the object for
which they are most proper: these
subjects moreover, being engaged at
a mature age, after a long probation,
and all the time necessary for
reflexion, are less exposed to disgust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and to repentance, more attached to
the society, and more disposed to
employ their talents for its glory,
and for their own, which comes only
afterward.</p>

<p>A second reason of the superiority
of the Jesuits over the other orders,
in respect to the sciences and knowledge,
is, that they have sufficient time
for resigning themselves up to study,
enjoying in this point as much liberty
as can possibly be enjoyed in a
regular community, not being subjected,
as the other orders are, to the
minute practices of devotion, and to
offices which absorb the greatest part
of the day. If it were not known
that hatred makes arms of every
thing, we should have some difficulty
to believe, that during their great
and fatal law-suit, it was gravely objected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to them as a crime, in some of
the Jansenist pamphlets, that they did
not assemble together so often as
other monks, to say, in common, matins
and prayers; as if a religious society
(the first duty of which is to
be useful) had nothing better to do
than to chant over heavily bad Latin
several hours in the day. It will be
said perhaps, that religious orders are
instituted only for prayer: be it so;
but in that case let the religious shut
themselves up in their houses, in order
to pray there quite at their ease,
and let them be hindered from meddling
in any thing else.</p>

<p>This suppression of praying and
chanting, among the Jesuits, before
it became a subject of reproach
against them, had been matter of
pleasantry, agreeably to the genius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of our nation: “The Jesuits,” said
they, “cannot sing, for birds of prey
never do: they are,” said they
again, “a set of folks who get
up at four in the morning, in
order to repeat together the
litanies at eight in the evening.”
The Jesuits had the good sense to
laugh the first at these French
witticisms, and to make no change
in their manner of living; they
thought it more serviceable and more
honourable to them, to have Petaus
and Bourdaloues, than triflers and
chanters.</p>

<p>It must be confessed nevertheless,
that in the sciences and the arts, two
kinds have been but feebly cultivated
by the Jesuits: these are French poetry
and philosophy. The best of
their French poets is beneath mediocrity;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
yet French poetry requires,
in order to excel in it, a delicacy of
feeling and taste, which cannot be
acquired but by frequenting the world
much more than a religious ought to
permit himself to do. This school of
urbanity and delicacy is perhaps the
only thing that was wanting to the
Jesuit Le Moine to make him a
poet of the first rank;  for that Jesuit,
according to the judgement
given of him by one of our greatest
masters, had, in other respects, an
imagination that was prodigious<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.
If it be asked why the Jesuits have
not had French poets, we must
ask why the universities have not
had more of them, and why so
many modern Latin poets, taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
throughout the several communities,
and throughout all conditions,
have not been able to succeed in
making two tolerable French lines
in verse.</p>

<p>Philosophy (I mean the true, for
school-learning is nothing but the
dregs and refuse of it) has not shone
with greater lustre among the Jesuits;
but has it been more brilliant among
the other orders? It is almost impossible
that a member of any community
should become a great philosopher:
the spirit of a society, of a
monastick society in particular, and
more perhaps than any other, the
domineering spirit of the Jesuits,
that of a servile devotion to their
superiors, are so many fetters to reason,
repugnant to that freedom of
thinking which is so necessary to philosophy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Malebranche is the only philosopher
of eminence that ever belonged
to a regular congregation; but that
congregation was composed of free-men;
and, besides, Malebranche is
perhaps less a great philosopher, than
an excellent philosophic writer.</p>

<p>If any order (by the by) could have
hoped to dispute with the Jesuits the
pre-eminence in the sciences and in
literature, and perhaps to have borne
away the palm from them, it is this
congregation of the Oratory, of which
Malebranche was a most distinguished
member. The freedom enjoyed
there, without being ever hampered
by vows, the permission of thinking
differently from their superiors,
and of employing their talents according
to their own pleasure, this
was what furnished the congregation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of the Oratory with excellent preachers,
profound scholars, men illustrious
in every way. Accordingly the
Jesuits were very sensible what they
had to fear from such rivals. They
persecuted them; and the members
of the Oratory had the folly to expose
a weak side to them by becoming
Jansenists<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. By this means
they furnished a pretext to the attacks
of their enemies, and have had
the grief to see the decay of their
congregation brought about by their
own fault. They have indeed just
now collected a few tattered remains
from the plunder of the Jesuits;
but these remains will hardly ever
be able to replace what they have
lost. We ought, besides, to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
them the justice to own, that they
testified not any eagerness to profit
by the ruin of their adversaries: the
society in its misfortune experienced,
on the part of the Oratory, a moderation
of which they had never given
them the example. But be this moderation
counterfeit or sincere, it is
difficult to persuade one’s-self that
the Oratory will ever recover with
lustre the blows which have been
given it by the Jesuits: the varnish
of Jansenism with which it is still
stained, and which renders it at least
suspected by the greater part of the
bishops, the almost general prejudice
of the public, and of the
greater part of the magistrates,
against all communities, of whatever
kind they be, and, above all, the
philosophic spirit which makes every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
day great progress, seems to forebode
the end of this, and of other fraternities.</p>

<p>If the culture of the sciences and
of letters has contributed to render
the society commendable, and intrigue
to make it powerful, another
circumstance has not a little served
to render it formidable to its enemies:
and that is the union of all its members
for the good of the common cause.
In other societies, the interests and reciprocal
hatred of individuals almost
always hurt the good of the corps;
but among the Jesuits it is quite
otherwise. Not that in this society
the individuals love each other better
than elsewhere; perhaps they even
hate one another more, being by their
very constitutions spies and informers,
from their birth, upon each other: yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
attack a single person among them,
you are sure of having the whole society
for your enemy. Thus heretofore
the Senate and Roman people,
often divided among themselves by
intestin dissensions, united at the bare
name of the Carthaginians or of Mithridates.
There is not a Jesuit who
may not say, like the wicked spirit
in scripture, “My name is Legion.”
Never did republican love his country
as every Jesuit loves his society:
the very lowest of its members interests
himself in its glory, of which
he thinks some rays reflect upon himself:
there is not (if I may presume
to say so) even to their brother the
apothecary, or the cook, one among
them who is not proud and jealous
of it. They are all at once put in
action by this single spring, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
one man directs at his pleasure;
and it is not without reason that they
have been defined “a naked sword,
the hilt of which is at Rome.”
The love which they have for their
society, subsists even in almost all
those who have left it: whether
it be a real attachment founded
upon gratitude, or a policy founded
on interest or on fear, there is hardly
an ex-Jesuit who preserves not his
connexions with his old brethren;
and who, even tho’ he has reason
to complain of them, does not shew
himself attached to their interests,
and ready to defend them against
their enemies. For the rest, this
attachment of the Jesuits to their
society, can be nothing but the effect
of that pride which it inspires
them with, and not at all of the advantages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
which it procures for each
of its members. Independently of
the little confidence and real friendship
which they have one for the other,
and the severe life which they lead
within their houses, individuals, whatever
merit they may have, are not at
all considered in the corps, but in proportion
to the talent which they have
for intrigue: modest merit, or such as
is confined to the labour of the closet,
is there unknown, little considered,
sometimes persecuted, if unfortunately
the pressing interest of the society
demand it. We have seen in these
late times the fathers Brumoi and
Bougeant, the last of the Jesuits
who had any true and solid merit,
die of chagrin under the weight
of the persecutions which their fraternity
were obliged to make them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
suffer: these two men, who were
greater philosophers, and more enlightened,
than their state in life
seemed to permit, were sacrificed by
the society to the clamours which
they had excited; the one by approving
a work, in which the regent
of the kingdom (who had been
dead about twenty years before) was
indirectly attacked; the other, by a
philosophical joke on “the language
of beasts,” for which they obliged
him to make reparation, by confining
him to the college of la Flêche,
and charging him with the <i>making</i>
of a catechism, which brought him
down to the grave, overwhelmed
with disgust and vexation. A hundred
years before, Petau, the famous
Petau, had like to have experienced
fate very nearly similar, for having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
pretended, that before the council of
Nice the church was not fully determined
on the divinity of the word<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.
He died in the college of the Jesuits
at Paris, abandoned and in want of
every thing. It seems as if the device
of the society had been that of
the ancient Romans; <i>Salus populi
suprema lex esto</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8"
id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>To all these means of augmenting
their consideration and their credit,
they join another no less efficacious:
this is the regularity of their conduct
and manners. Their discipline on
this point is as severe as it is prudent;
and whatever calumny may have
published concerning it, it must be
confessed, that no religious order
gives less handle in this respect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Even those among them who have
taught the most monstrous doctrine,
who have written on the most obscene
subjects, have led the most
edifying and the most exemplary
lives. It was at the feet of the crucifix
that the pious Sanchez wrote his
abominable and disgusting work:
and it has been said, in particular, of
Escobar, equally known by the austerity
of his manners, and the looseness
of his doctrines, that he purchased
heaven very dear for himself,
but bestowed it at an easy rate upon
others.</p>

<p>We have seen what success the Jesuits
had the art to procure themselves
at the court of France: their progress
was nearly the same in almost
all the other courts: at the beginning
of the present century there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
not in Europe a catholic prince, of
whose conscience they were not the directors,
and from whom they had not
obtained the most signal favours; in all
parts their enemies raged, and in all
parts they made a jest of their enemies.</p>

<p>They confined not their ambition
to Europe; perpetually full of the
project of governing, and of governing
by religion, they sent to the
Indies, and to China, missionaries,
who carried thither christianity for
the people, and the profane sciences for
the princes, for the grandees, and
for the more enlightened persons,
whom by these means they might
render favourable to them.</p>

<p>Let us stop here a moment, and
examine more particularly, by what
kind of learning and doctrine the
Jesuits were able to make such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
great progress among the Christians,
and among those who were not so.</p>

<p>The religion which we profess
turns upon two points; its tenets
and its morality. Among its tenets
are the Trinity, the Redemption,
the Real Presence, &amp;c. which, in appearing
to confound the human understanding,
present to its belief
only truths that are speculative in
themselves: these sorts of truths,
how obscure soever they seem to reason,
and how much submission soever
they require from it, are not
those which meet with the most opposition
from the multitude: naturally
inclined to the marvellous, they
are disposed to adopt blindly the most
absurd errors in this kind, and much
more the truths which are only incomprehensible,
provided they oppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
not their inclinations. The Jesuits
therefore preached those truths
in all their exactness; they knew
well that they risked not much. But
there are other tenets, as those of
Predestination and of Grace, which
border on practical religion, and
which, preached in all their rigour
to minds that are unprepared, would
be little adapted to make proselytes.
We must take great care, said the
wise and pious Fleury, not to propose
at once to infidels, those articles
of our belief, which might shock
them too much. Suppose a missionary
should come and say abruptly
to savages, “My children, I
make known to you a God, whom
you cannot serve worthily, without
his special grace, which he has resolved
from all eternity to give, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to refuse you.” “Very well,” the
savages would say to him, “we will
wait for that grace, and till it come
we will remain in our present
faith.” What success would the
Jesuits have had, had they proceeded
in this manner? Let us suppose that
a Jansenist had been in their place, to
preach his incomprehensible doctrine
(which he calls nevertheless modestly
the doctrine of St. Augustine and
St. Paul) he would soon have been
either abandoned as a madman, or
driven away by the people with
stones. The Jesuits conducted themselves
much more dexterously; they
proved, according to the saying of
their enemies, the truth of that maxim
of scripture, that the children of
darkness act with more prudence in
their affairs than the children of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
light: they preached to the people
they wanted to convert that
Pelagianism of which they make
profession, and which is much more
accommodated to the weakness and
vanity of human nature; but they
not only preached in a manner better
suited to humanity than the Jansenists
would have done; they preached also
more artfully than would Pelagius
himself. The heresy of that monk
did not meet with the success it might
have had, because it stuck half way.
Pelagius, while he restored to freedom
her rights, imposed on her severe
ties, by the morality which he
recommended to practice: this morality
was that of the Christian religion
in all its austerity, the renouncing
of one’s-self, a penitence the
most rigorous, and an eternal warfare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
against the passions. The Jesuits
perceived that these painful duties
were not made for the common run
of mankind, and it was the multitude
they wanted to attract to
them. After having softened what
the doctrines of Predestination and
Grace have too harsh in appearance,
they did the same with what the ties
imposed by Christianity have too difficult.
Great personages, for the
most part, are, by the fault of their
education, superstitious, ignorant,
and given up to their passions. The
Jesuits permitted them to have mistresses,
provided they displayed a zeal
for religion, and an attachment to its
outward forms, which are no more
than a kind of amusement when the
passions are satisfied, and which serve
besides, to consciences that are but ill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
enlightened, by way of a quieter, or,
if you will, a palliative in their
hours of remorse. They followed
pretty nearly the same plan with regard
to all those whom they directed,
and succeeded in making, by these
means, a great number of partisans.
The Jesuitical spirit, in the manner
of teaching religion, is pretty well
described in the definition which the
Abbé Boileau gave of these fathers:
“They are (said he) a people who
lengthen the creed, and shorten
the decalogue.”</p>

<p>I cannot help remarking, on this
occasion, one singular contradiction
of the human mind in matters of
religion. The Jansenists are at once
what it seems impossible to be at the
same time, Predestinarians in opinion,
and Rigorists in morality:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
they say to man, “You have great
duties to fulfill, but you can do
nothing of yourself; and whatever
you do, what human virtues soever
you practise, every one of your actions
will be <span class="smcap">A NEW CRIME</span>; at least
unless God sanctify you by his
grace, which you will not obtain
if you are not predestined to it
gratuitously and before the foreknowledge
of your merits.” It
must be confessed, that this doctrine
is mild, adapted to consolation, and
above all consistent! But in these
sorts of matters, the business is not
to be consistent and reasonable;
it is the temper of the person who
dogmatises, and not logic, that dictates
to him what he is to preach.
The Jansenist, unpitying in his nature,
is equally so, both in his doctrines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and in the morality which he
teaches; he is little embarrassed that
the one is contrary to the other: the
nature of the God that he preaches
(and who, happily for us, is only his
own) is to be harsh as himself, both
in what he would have us do, and
in what he wills that we should believe.
What would be thought of
a monarch, who should say to one
of his subjects, “You have irons on
your legs, and you have not the
power to take them off; however
I now inform you, that if you
walk not presently, both for a
long time, and very upright, on
the brink of the precipice on which
you now stand, you shall be condemned
to eternal punishment<a name="FNanchor_9_9"
id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>?”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Such is the God of the Jansenists;
such is their theology in its original
and primitive purity. Pelagius, in
his error, was more reasonable. He
said to man, “You can do every
thing; but you have a great deal
to do.” This doctrine was less
shocking to reason; but, however,
very incommodious and irksome.
The Jesuits have, if we may say so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
beat down Pelagius’s price: they
have said to Christians,  “You can
do every thing, and God requires
but little of you.” This is the
way in which we must speak to carnal
people; and especially to the
great of the age, whenever we would
have them listen to us.</p>

<p>These are not the only cautions
which they have taken; for they
have thought of every thing. They
have had (indeed in small number) severe
casuists and directors; compared
with the small number of those, who
thro’ temper or scruple wanted to impose,
in all its rigour, the yoke of the
gospel. By this means, making themselves,
to use the expression, “all to
all,” according to a saying of scripture
(the sense of which indeed they
wrested a little) on one side they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
procured to themselves friends of
every kind; and on the other they
refuted, or thought they refuted, before-hand,
the objection which might
be made to them, of teaching universally
looseness of morals, and of having
made it the uniform doctrine of their
society. This kind of complete assortment,
designed to satisfy all tastes,
is pretty well described in the following
well-known lines of Despréaux:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">Si Bourdaloue un peu sévère</div>
       <div class="verse">Nous dit, craignez la volupté,</div>
       <div class="verse">Escobar, lui dit-on, mon père,</div>
       <div class="verse">Nous la permet pour la santé.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It must also be observed, that most
of those Jesuits, who were so severe
in their writings, or in their sermons,
were less so towards their penitents.
It has been said of Bourdaloue
himself, that if he required too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in the pulpit, he abated it in the
confessional chair: a new stroke of
policy, well understood on the part
of the Jesuits, in as much as speculative
severity suits persons of rigid
morals, and practical condescension
attracts the multitude.</p>

<p>In China they employed still
other methods: they rendered light
to the people the yoke which they
came to impose on them, by permitting
them to mingle with the practical
duties of Christianity, some
ceremonies of the religion of the
country; to which the multitude,
every where superstitious and tumultuous,
was too firmly attached.</p>

<p>This philosophy, so purely human,
which sees in the zeal of the
Jesuits, and of many others, to go
and preach religion at the extremities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of the earth, nothing more than
a means which they make use of for
becoming of consequence and powerful,
regards, as the most dexterous
of their missionaries, those who
know how best to arrive at that end.
We must not then be astonished, if
the society is a little surprised at the
number of invectives and clamours,
of which these fathers have been the
object, on account of the Chinese
superstitions which they permitted to
their new converts. In that, as well
as in the rest of their conduct, to the
very time of their destruction, they
have proved, we repeat it, that they
knew mankind better than their adversaries
did: they perceived that they
were not to frighten or disgust their
new converts, by prohibiting them
a few national practices which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
dear to them, and which they still
have it in their power to interpret
as they please. Pope Gregory,
who is called the Great, and who
was certainly a man of good sense,
seems, if we may believe the Jesuits,
to have set them, in that respect,
the example: they have, at least,
pretended to the authority of it.
Augustine the monk, whom this
pope had sent into England, to
convert the people who were yet
barbarous, consulted him on some
remains of ceremonies, partly civilized,
partly Pagan, which the new
converts were unwilling to renounce:
he demanded of Gregory, whether
he might permit them those ceremonies.
“There is no taking away,”
replied that pope, “from rugged
minds, all their habits at once:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
we ascend not a steep rock by leaping
on it, but by clambering up
step by step.” We see here the
principle on which the Jesuits pretend
to have conducted themselves
in China. They were persuaded,
that without this condescension, the
religion which they preached would
not have been even heard there. I
have no doubt, but artful as they
are, (or rather as they were) they
have still further palliated and mitigated
matters with respect to other
points: and it cannot be denied,
that they have done well, relatively
to their own views; since, after all, it
was neither God nor Christianity
that they wanted to reign there; it
was the society under those respectable
names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Furthermore, neither the severe
morality of religion, nor the doctrines
of grace which they were accused of
misrepresenting, are delivered in so exclusive
a manner in scripture, as that
we do not meet there also with several
passages favourable to the most moderate
opinions: and we may easily
believe, that the Jesuits availed themselves
of those passages, after the example
of so many sects which have
found in the Bible, and in the fathers,
matter to support their opinions,
while their adversaries found there
in like manner wherewith to combat
them. The scriptures are, if I may
use the expression, common arsenals,
to which every one goes, in order to
arm himself from head to foot, and
just as he pleases. Accordingly it
is not without reason that the catholic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
church has decided, that it belonged
to her alone to give to infidels
the true sense of the scriptures, and of
the fathers: a truth from which we
cannot deviate, without exposing ourselves
to a dangerous Pyrrhonism in
matter of doctrine.</p>

<p>What is very singular, and must
appear more strange still to the proselytes,
whom they went to make at
five thousand leagues distance from
our continent of Europe, is, that
while the Jesuits preached Christianity
after their manner, other missionaries,
their enemies, monks and
seculars, preached it quite differently
to the same people; warning them,
at the same time, under pain of damnation,
not to believe in the catechism
of the Jesuits. We may judge
of the effect which these contests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
would produce. “Indeed, gentlemen,”
said the emperor of China
to them, “you take a great deal of
trouble in coming so far to preach
to us contradictory opinions, concerning
which you are ready to cut
one another’s throats.” After having
made them this representation,
he left them to preach as long as
they would, persuaded that such
apostles could not have any great
success. He availed himself besides,
for the good of his country, of the
residence of the Jesuits, who talked
much more at court of astronomy
and natural philosophy, than of the
Trinity and religion, and who succeeded
at last in rendering the other
missionaries either suspected or contemptible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not that they were not very
ready to expose themselves to the
greatest dangers, and even to death,
for the sake of that religion which
they burlesqued in their manner of
preaching it, and which served only
as an instrument to their ambition.
When the emperor of Japan judged
it proper (for reasons which appeared
to him indispensible) to exterminate
Christianity from his territories, the
Jesuits had there their martyrs as well
as others, and even in greater numbers.
The reader will not be surprised
at it, when he knows what
was told me by a person extremely
worthy of credit. He was particularly
acquainted with a Jesuit, who
had been employed twenty years in
the missions of Canada; and who,
while he did not believe a God, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
he owned privately to this friend,
had faced death twenty times for the
sake of the religion which he preached
with success to the savages. This
friend represented to the Jesuit the
inconsistency of his zeal: “Ah!” replied
the missionary, “you have no
idea of the pleasure which is felt
in commanding the attention of
twenty thousand people, and in
persuading them to what we believe
not ourselves.”</p>

<p>Such is the spirit of the method
which the Jesuits have followed, for
teaching with success to mankind
what they called religion and Christian
morality. Such was the moderate
doctrine which they preached at
the court of Louis XIV. and by
means of which they succeeded in
rendering themselves so agreeable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Accordingly it was principally under
the reign of that prince that the
power, the credit, and opulence of
the Jesuits received in France such
prodigious aggrandizements: it was
under this reign that they succeeded
in rendering the clergy dependent on
them (we may even say their slaves)
by the disposal of benefices, with
which the fathers la Chaize and le
Tellier, the king’s confessors, were
successively entrusted: it was in this
reign that they succeeded, in consequence
of the need which the
bishops stood in of them, in extorting,
even while they braved them,
their confidence, or the appearance
of their confidence, and in obtaining
the direction of several seminaries;
in which the youth, destined
to the church, were brought up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
their doctrines, and in the hatred of
their enemies: it was under this
reign that they succeeded, by decrying
or vilifying the other orders and
the secular ecclesiasticks, in invading
a great number of colleges, or at least
in obtaining permission for establishing
new ones: it was under this reign
that they succeeded so far, through
the confidence and consideration
which Louis XIV. gave them, as to
draw all the court to their college of
Clermont. We remember still the
mark of flattery which they bestowed
on that monarch, by divesting that
college of the name which it bore of
the <i>Society of Jesus</i>, in order to call
it the college of <i>Louis the Great</i>;
and nobody is ignorant of the Latin
distich which was made on that occasion,
and in which the society was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
reproached “with acknowledging
no other God but the king.” Thus
they represented them at once as idolaters
of despotism, in order to render
them vile, and as preachers of
regicide, in order to render them
odious: these two accusations might
appear a little contradictory, but the
business was not to speak the exact
truth; it was to say of the Jesuits as
much ill as possible.</p>

<p>Lastly, what completed the power
and glory of the society was, that
under Louis XIV. the Jesuits succeeded
in destroying, or at least in
oppressing in France the Protestants
and the Jansenists, their eternal enemies;
the Protestants, by contributing
to the revocation of the edict of
Nantes, that source of depopulation
and of evils to this kingdom; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Jansenists, by depriving them of the
ecclesiastical dignities, by arming the
bishops against them, by forcing them
to go and preach, and write in foreign
countries, where even these unfortunate
people still found persecution.</p>

<p>Under this very reign in which
the Jesuits were so powerful, and so
formidable, the most terrible strokes
were given them, more terrible perhaps
than any they had felt till that
time. The pleadings of Pasquier
and Arnaud were but bombast satyrs,
and in a bad taste: the <i>Provincial
Letters</i> gave them a wound much
more deadly: this master-piece of
pleasantry and eloquence diverted and
moved the indignation of all Europe
at their expense. In vain they replied,
that the greatest part of the theologists
and monks had taught, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
as them, the scandalous doctrine
which they were reproached with:
their answers, ill written, and full
of gall, were not read, while every
body knew the <i>Provincial Letters</i>
by heart. This work is so much the
more admirable, as Paschal in composing
it appears to have divined two
things, which seemed not made for
divination, language, and pleasantry.
The language was very far from being
formed, as we may judge by the
greater part of the works published
at that time, and of which it is impossible
to endure the reading: in
the <i>Provincial Letters</i> there is not a
single word that is grown obsolete;
and that book, though written above
a hundred years ago, seems as if it
had been written but yesterday.
Another attempt, no less difficult,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
was to make people of wit and good
folks laugh at the questions of <i>sufficient
grace</i>, <i>next power</i>, and the decisions
of the casuists; subjects very
little favourable to pleasantry, or,
which is worse still, susceptible of
pleasantries that are cold and uniform,
and capable at most of amusing
only priests and monks. It was
necessary, for avoiding this rock, to
have a delicacy of taste so much the
greater, as Paschal lived very retired,
and far removed from the commerce
of the world: he could never have distinguished,
but by the superiority and
delicacy of his understanding, the
kind of pleasantry which could alone
be relished by good judges in this
dry and insipid matter. He succeeded
in it beyond all expression:
several of his bon-mots have even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
become proverbial in our language,
and the <i>Provincial Letters</i> will be ever
regarded as a model of taste and style.
It is only to be feared, that the expulsion
of the Jesuits, lessening the
interest which we took in this book,
may render the perusal of it less poignant,
and perhaps make it be one day
forgot. This is a fate which the
most eloquent author has to apprehend,
if he writes not on subjects that
are useful to every nation, and to all
ages: the duration of a work, whatever
merit it may have in other
respects, is almost necessarily connected
with that of its object.
The <i>Thoughts of Paschal</i>, greatly inferior
to the <i>Provincials</i>, will live
perhaps longer, because there is all
reason to believe (whatever the
humble society may say of it) that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Christianity will last longer than
they.</p>

<p>The <i>Provincials</i> would be perhaps
more assured of the immortality
which they merit in so many respects,
if their illustrious author, that genius
so elevated, so universal, and so little
formed for taking an interest in scholastick
trumpery, had turned alike
both parties into ridicule. The
shocking doctrine of Jansenius, and
of St. Cyran, afforded at least as much
room for it as the pliant doctrine of
Molina, Tambourin, and Vasquez.
Every work, in which we sacrifice
with success to the publick laughter
fanaticks who worry one another,
subsists even after those fanaticks
are no more. I might venture to
foretell this advantage to the chapter
<i>on Jansenism</i>, which we read with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
so much pleasure in the excellent
<i>Essay on General History</i>, by the most
agreeable of our philosophical writers.
The irony is scattered in that chapter
to the right and left, with a
delicacy and ease which must cover
both the one and the other with
indelible contempt, and make them
weary of cutting one anothers’ throats
for nonsensical fancies. Methinks I
see Fontaine’s cat<a name="FNanchor_10_10"
id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>,
before whom the rabbit and the weasel bring their
suit on the subject of a pitiful hole
which they contend for; and who,
by way of decision,</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>No body is perhaps fitter than this
illustrious writer, to form a history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of theological quarrels, in order to
render them at once both odious and
ridiculous, and thereby deliver mankind
for ever from this shameful and
terrible scourge.</p>

<p><i>The Practical Morals of the Jesuits</i>,
written by doctor Arnauld, which
came out soon after the <i>Provincials</i>,
though of a merit greatly inferior,
put the finishing stroke to the throwing
upon these fathers an odium,
which they will never be able to
wash off. This unfavourable and
deep impression, which is perpetually
kept up by the reading of these
books, has even now found, at the
end of a century, minds disposed to
believe all the ill which has been
said of the Jesuits, and of approving
all the mischief that has been done
to them. The term of <i>Jesuitical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
morals</i> has been, as it were, consecrated
in our language, to signify
loose morals, and that of <i>Escobarderie</i>
to signify an artful lie: and we know
how much weight a fashionable way
of speaking carries with it, especially
in France, towards procuring credit
to opinions.</p>

<p>The Jesuits, loaded from that time
with so much hatred, and such a
number of imputations, were not to
be till long after the victims of it:
they triumphed in the first violence
of the attack, and became but the
more powerful, the more animated
against their enemies, and the more
formidable to them. Yet what enemies
had they to deal with? With
men of the greatest merit and reputation,
and whose consideration
with the public still increased by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
their very persecution; an Arnauld,
a Nicole, a Saci; in one word, all the
writers of the celebrated house of
Port-Royal. These adversaries were
much more to be dreaded by the society
than plain theologists, whom
the common run of mankind listen
not to, understand not, and have no
esteem for: they were great philosophers
(as great at least as could be
in those days) men of the first class
in literature, excellent writers, and
men of an irreproachable conduct.
They had in the kingdom, and even
at court, respectable and zealous
friends, whom they acquired by their
talents, their virtues, and the signal
services for which literature was indebted
to them. The general and
rational grammar, called the <i>Port-Royal</i>
grammar, from their being the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
authors of it; the excellent <i>Logic</i> called
by the same name; the <i>Greek
Roots</i>; their learned grammars of the
Greek, Latin, Italian, and Spanish;
such were the productions of this
free and respectable society. The
illustrious Racine had been their scholar,
and had preserved, as well as
Despréaux, his friend, the most intimate
connections with them: their
works on religion and morality were
read and esteemed by all France;
and by the masculine and correct
style in which they were written,
had contributed most of any, next
to the <i>Provincials</i>, to the perfection
of our language, while the Jesuits
counted yet among their French writers
only des Barris and des Garrasses.
What pity that those writers of the
Port-Royal, those men of such superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
merit, should have thrown away
so much genius and time in ridiculous
controversies on the good or
bad doctrine of Jansenius, on idle
and endless discussions on free-will
and grace, and on the important
question, Whether five unintelligible
propositions be in a book which
nobody reads? Tormented, imprisoned,
exiled for these vain disputes,
and employed perpetually in defending
so futile a cause, how many
years of their lives have philosophy
and letters to regret as lost! What
lights would they not have added to
those with which they had already
illumined their age, if they had not
been carried away by these unhappy
and pitiful distractions, so unworthy
of taking up the thoughts of men like
them! May we venture to say a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
more of this, at the risk of deviating
one moment from our subject? Can
reason withhold shedding bitter tears,
when she sees how many useful talents
the quarrels, so often excited
in the bosom of Christianity, have
buried? how many ages these wretched
and scandalous contests have destroyed
to the human understanding?
and how many geniuses, formed
for discovering new truths, have
employed (to the great regret of
true religion) all their sagacity and
abilities, in supporting or giving
reputation to ancient absurdities?
When we run through, in the vast
royal library, the first apartment, of
an immense extent, and find it destined,
for the greatest part, to a
collection, without number, of the
most visionary commentators on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
scriptures, of polemical writers on,
questions the most void of meaning,
of school divines of every sort;
in short, of so many works from
whence there is no drawing one
single page of truth, can we refrain
crying out with sorrow (<i>ad quid
perditio hæc?</i>) “To what end all this
loss?” Again, human nature would
have been in no very great degree to
be pitied, if all these frivolous and
absurd objects, these <i>holy trifles</i>, as
a celebrated magistrate calls them<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>,
had ended in ill language only, and
had not occasioned the shedding of
torrents of blood. But let us shut
our eyes on these dismal objects,
and make only one other reflexion, as
consolatory as it is humiliating to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
human mind. How is it possible,
that the same species of beings which
invented the art of writing, arithmetic,
astronomy, algebra, chemistry,
watch-work, the art of weaving,
so many things in short worthy
of admiration in the mechanical and
liberal arts, should have invented
the philosophy and divinity of the
schools, judicial astrology, the concomitant
concourse, versatile and
congruous grace, the victorious delectation,
absolute accidents, and so
many other fooleries, as would occasion
the suspending, by authority of
justice, the person who should first
broach them now-a-days? Plato defined
man, “an animal with two feet
without feathers.” How ridiculous
soever this definition may appear, it
was perhaps difficult (the lights of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
religion set aside) to characterise
otherwise the indefinable human
species; which on one side seems, by
master-pieces of genius, to have approached
the heavenly beings, and
on the other, by a thousand incredible
marks of folly and cruelty, to have
set itself on a level with the most stupid
and ferocious animals. When we
measure the interval between a Scotus
and a Newton, or rather between the
works of Scotus and those of Newton,
we must cry out with Terence,
<i>Homo homini quid præstat!</i> “What
difference there is between man
and man!” Or must we only attribute
this immense distance to the
enormous difference of ages, and
think with sorrow that the <i>subtile</i>
and <i>absurd doctor</i>, who wrote so
many chimeras, admired by his contemporaries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
had perhaps been a
Newton in an age more enlightened?
Let us weigh well all these reflexions;
let us add thereto the perusal of ecclesiastical
history, those kalendars of
the virtue of some men, and the
weak wickedness of so many others;
let us behold in that history the
usurpations, without number, of the
spiritual power; the robberies and
the violences exercised under the pretext
of religion; so many bloody
wars, so many cruel persecutions, so
many murders committed in the
name of a God who abhors them;
and we shall have pretty nearly an
exact catalogue of the advantages
which the disputes of Christianity
have brought upon mankind.</p>

<p>To return to the Jesuits, the nomination
of father le Tellier to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
place of confessor to Louis XIV.
furnished them with an opportunity
of wreaking fully their vengeance.
This violent and inflexible man,
hated by his very brethren, whom he
governed with a rod of iron, made
the Jansenists drink “to the very
dregs,” according to his own expression,
“of the cup of the society’s
indignation.” Scarce was he in
place, but they foresaw the evils of
which he would be the cause: and
Fontenelle the philosopher said, on
learning his nomination, “the Jansenists
have sinned.”</p>

<p>The first exploit of this ferocious
and fiery Jesuit, was the destruction
of Port-Royal, where not one stone
was left upon another, and from
whence they dug up the very corpses
that were interred there. This violence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
executed with the last barbarity,
against a house respectable for
the celebrated persons who had inhabited
it, and against poor nuns, more
worthy of compassion than of hatred,
excited clamours throughout the
whole kingdom: these clamours have
re-echoed down even to our times;
and the Jesuits themselves confessed,
on seeing the spectacle of their destruction,
that the stones of Port-Royal
were falling on their own
heads to crush them.</p>

<p>But the indignation which the destruction
of Port-Royal excited against
them, was nothing in comparison of
the general commotion which the
bull <i>Unigenitus</i> occasioned. It is
certain that this bull was their work:
we know also the universal opposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
which it produced in almost all
the orders of the state: we know the
intrigues, the frauds, the violences,
which were put in practice to extort
the acceptance of it. We may remember
that Louis XIV. having succeeded
in making it to be received
(partly by foul and partly by fair means)
by an assembly of forty prelates, saw
with pain nine bishops who remained
in opposition to it: he could have wished,
for the peace of his conscience,
an entire uniformity in the episcopal
corps. “That is very easy,” said
the duchess his daughter to him,
“you need only order the forty acceptants
to be of the opinion of
the nine others.” The propositions
condemned were, for the most
part, so ill chosen, that it is pretended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
that a great prince, on reading
them in the bull, took them for
truths which it enjoined to be believed,
appeared edified by them, and
was very much surprised, though of
a docile disposition, when his confessor
undeceived him.</p>

<p>The magistrates were not the last
to rise against this bull. They were
especially shocked at the censure of
the ninety-first proposition. “The
dread of an unjust excommunication
ought never to hinder us from
doing our duty.” Instructed by
the melancholy effects of the quarrels
between the Priesthood and the Empire
during so many ages, they perceived
how easy it was to avail themselves
of this censure, to detach the
people, by menaces of excommunication,
from the fidelity which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
owe their sovereign. They saw, in
so rash a condemnation, the secret
attempt which the Jesuits and the
court of Rome wanted to make upon
our maxims, of the temporal independence
of kings. There was no
subscribing, with any modesty, to the
Anathema launched out against a
proposition so evident, but by confining
it to a tortured sense, which it
presents not, in judging it (which is
ridiculous in such a case) upon a pretended
intention of the author in favour
of excommunicated fanaticks.
Who doubts that fanaticks might
not abuse the truth which this proposition
includes, to the braving of every
excommunication which they shall
think unjust? But is the abuse, which
may be made of a truth, a reason for
proscribing it? Would the scripture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
itself be safe from a stigma founded
on like motives?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of the opposition
of the magistrates, the bull
was registered; every thing plyed,
either willingly or by force, under
the weight of the royal authority:
the fury with which father le Tellier,
the author of this strange production,
persecuted all its opposers, was carried
so far, that the Jesuits themselves,
though long inured to violence,
were terrified at his, and said
aloud, “Father le Tellier drives at
such a rate, that he will overturn
us.” They thought not perhaps
that they were speaking so much
truth. It is this bull, and the persecution
which it occasioned, that
after fifty years has given the Jesuits
the mortal blow: we shall see it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in the sequel of this recital. But
it may not be useless to make,
before-hand, an observation on the
conduct and the projects of father le
Tellier. Many people believe, that
this Jesuit was a knave, void of religion,
who made its respectable
name subservient to his hatred: it is
much more probable that he was
a fanatick in reality, who, being persuaded
of the goodness of his cause,
thought every thing permitted him,
in order to ensure the triumph of
what he supposed to be <i>the sound
doctrine</i>. At the same time that
he persecuted the Jansenists, he accused
Fontenelle to Louis XIV. as
an atheist, for having written <i>The
History of Oracles</i>. Fontenelle, the
pupil of the Jesuits, their friend at
all times, as well as the great Corneille
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
his uncle, disapproving also
the doctrine and morality of the
Jansenists, as far as a philosopher
can disapprove theological opinions;
in short, ever discreet and reserved
with respect to religion, in his discourses,
as well as in his writings;
such was the man whom le Tellier
wanted to ruin, at the very time
that he sought to crush Quesnel and
his partisans. Would he have behaved
in this manner, if he had not
been animated by a principle of persuasion?</p>

<p>Happily for Jansenism and for philosophy,
Louis XIV. died. Le Tellier,
loaded with the public execration,
was exiled to la Flêche, where
he ended, in a short time, a life odious
to the whole nation. The duke of
Orleans the regent, being in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
respect the reverse of Louis XIV. was
disposed neither to brave with violence
the publick clamour, which the
constitution Unigenitus had excited,
nor rudely to offend the pope and
the bishops, who were too far engaged
to recede: he caused to be accepted,
almost without noise, this
fatal bull, which, presented by the
Jesuits, had excited such great clamours:
supported by the philosophers
who surrounded him, and who began,
from that time, to command
attention; supported above all by his
minister Dubois, whose way of thinking,
in matters of religion, was well
known, he threw over this theological
dispute, a ridicule which put
a stop to it.</p>

<p>The Jesuits, though become less
powerful during the regency, recovered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
nevertheless, in a short time,
the place of confessor to the king, of
which they had been for a short time
deprived: it is pretended that their
restoration at court was one of the
secret articles of the re-union between
France and Spain in 1719. It is added,
that this article had been procured
by the management of the Jesuit
d’Aubenton, confessor to Philip
V. and extremely powerful at the
court of Madrid. For the honour
of the ministers which France had
at that time, we must believe that
this anecdote is fabulous.</p>

<p>Everything else was peaceable,
with respect to the Jesuits, during
the remainder of the regency and
the succeeding ministry: they aimed
only at supporting themselves, without
making much noise. Cardinal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Fleury, who loved them not, was
nevertheless persuaded that they were
to be protected strongly, “as the
firmest supports of religion;” the
maintenance of which that minister
looked upon as a part of government.
This manner of thinking
in cardinal Fleury, with regard to
the Jesuits, is found expressed in
some manuscript letters of his, which
I have read.  “They are,” said he
further, “excellent servants, but
bad masters.” In pursuance of this
principle, he treated them civilly,
during his ministry, but without
shewing them any marks of declared
favour: on the contrary, he greatly
raised (and the Jesuits were not the
better pleased with him for it) the
community of Sulpiciens, who were
much less illustrious and less powerful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
but also less formidable. Cardinal
Fleury, an enemy to the Jansenists,
whom he looked upon as
dangerous, and at the same time very
little biassed for what had any considerable
degree of credit in its way,
of whatever kind it was, took under
his particular protection this numerous
community: it had all that
was necessary to make him think it
worthy thereof: it joined to the merit
of being extremely devoted to
the bull, the happiness of having
never made any noise. This minister
filled the bishopricks of France with
a multitude of the pupils of St.
Sulpicius, who were more commendable
for their devotion than
their talents: thus he planted the
first seeds of that state of languor
into which the clergy of France
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
seem now-a-days to be fallen, but
from which it is to be hoped they
will soon rouze themselves; thanks
to the philosophick spirit which enlightens
at present some of its members,
and which makes them justly
look upon fanaticism and ignorance
as the two true scourges of Christianity.</p>

<p>However, the bull of which the
Jesuits had been the promoters, and
which had met with so much opposition
when it appeared, came insensibly
to be received by all the bishops.
The French nation, which clamours
so readily, and which more readily still
grows tired of clamouring, was familiarized
to a production which it
had at first called <i>monstrous</i>: every
one received it, with an interpretation
according to his own liking; for such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
is the wonderful privilege of these
kinds of decisions of the church of
Rome, that people may, by all means,
understand them just as they please,
and submit to them at the same time
that they continue in their own opinion.
Jansenism, heretofore maintained
(in spite of reason) by men
of real merit, had no longer for its
support any defenders, but such as
were worthy of such a cause, a few
poor and obscure priests, unknown
even where they lived: the phrensy
of convulsions, which had raised dissensions
in the party itself, had rendered
them completely contemptible,
by rendering them ridiculous: in
short, this sect, now expiring and
despised, was at the last gasp, when
an unforeseen chain of circumstances
restored it to a new life, which it hoped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
not for. The viper which the Jesuits
thought crushed, had strength enough
to turn back its head, to bite them in
the heel, and to kill them. The
reader is here presented with the
succession of causes, by which this
strange event was produced.</p>

<p>The parliaments, which had opposed
the society from its birth,
had but too much reason for persisting
in the same sentiments with
regard to it. They were justly offended
at the advantages of power
and credit, which it had obtained in
spite of them: they were above all
hurt by the constitution <i>Unigenitus</i>,
the acceptance of which the intrigues
of the Jesuits had forced them to
register; an acceptance which they
thought, as we have seen, contrary
to the rights of the crown; and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
order to break forth, waited only for
a favourable occasion, without perhaps
presuming to flatter themselves
that it would ever occur.</p>

<p>The contest occasioned by the refusal
of the sacraments to the Jansenists,
was the first spark of the conflagration,
the Helen of that war, as small in
its first object, as it is now become
important by its consequences. One
of the principal archbishops of the
kingdom, and a bishop of Mirepoix,
his aid and counsellor, both of
them thoroughly persuaded of the
excellence of the bull, and of the
damnation of those who rejected it,
resolved, like consistent prelates, to
order the communion to be refused
to Jansenists at the point of death.
This refusal had before been attempted
in some provinces, but twice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
or thrice only, at wide intervals, and
with little noise: it was now thought
time to take off the mask, and absolutely
to treat the enemies of the
bull <i>Unigenitus</i> as hereticks cut off
from the church. If we believe
the crowd of constitutionary theologists,
the two prelates, authors and
executors of this project, were extremely
in the right: but let us be
permitted to relate here (as mere
historians) the singular reasons which
were alledged in their favour, and
those that were opposed to them.
“The bull <i>Unigenitus</i>,” said its partisans,
“ill received without doubt,
and even spit upon at its birth,
had terminated in being unanimously
received: there was not,
in all Christendom, one bishop
who rejected this production, whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
good or bad, of the court of
Rome: it was in vain to say that
it overturned the principles of
Christianity; that the acceptance
of it had not been free; that
some had received it through fear,
others through interest: it was
accepted, and without opposition,
by the whole body of pastors.
Here then we see, in the
principles of the Catholic church,
all that ought to serve, by way of
compass, to plain Christians in
their faith. It is not for them
to examine either the doctrines
themselves, or the nature of the
acceptance; it is sufficient to them
that they see clearly, that the visible
church adopts them. We understand
here by the visible church,
what every Catholic understands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
by the term; that is to say, the
pope, the bishops, and almost all
the ecclesiasticks, secular and regular,
of the second order. Whatever
be the doctrine which this
visible church teaches, the faithful
ought to believe firmly, notwithstanding
even the strongest appearances
to the contrary, that it has
always taught the same; otherwise
Jesus Christ would not have said
true in promising that church to be
always with her. The passages of
scripture, and of the fathers,
which may appear the most evidently
contrary to the new catechism,
will be explained in a
manner favourable to it: the
church has alone the right of
fixing the meaning of them. In
a word, from the moment the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
church speaks, we must submit to
her, whatever she may say. After
the council of Nice, the divinity
of Jesus Christ was very far from
being as solemnly, as universally,
as uniformly received by the body
of pastors, as the bull <i>Unigenitus</i>
hath been in these latter times.
Nevertheless, after the council of
Nice, the Arians were, from that
time, hereticks declared, not withstanding
the partisans that still adhered
to them. It may be; it
is even out of doubt, that in the
councils which have decided on
matters of faith, many of the
bishops declared for the good
cause, through views of policy,
interest, or passion. Witness the
unhappy facility with which most
of the prelates, who, under Constantine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
had declared that the
Word was God, declared afterwards,
under Constantius, that it
was but a man. Witness again
the violent conduct of St. Cyril,
and of the council of Ephesus,
with regard to Nestorius. Witness,
lastly, the intrigues which
too often disturbed those holy
assemblies, and affronted, as we
may say, the Holy Ghost, that presides
in them.  But still, once
more, it is not the motives, it is
the result of the decision, that the
faithful ought to consider. It is
by this result alone that they ought
to abide: they would have too
much to do, if it were necessary
for them to go back again to the
causes which dictated the decree.
God hath promised to his church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
infallibility in her decisions; but
he has not promised to every individual
purity in his motives: he
makes use of all sorts of means,
even of the passions of men, for
making the truth triumph, and be
known; and he employs human
things, in order to make divine
matters succeed.”</p>

<p>Agreeably to these reasonings (the
justness of which we pretend by no
means to judge of) the partisans of
the bull thought themselves warranted
to treat the Jansenists as declared
sectaries. The latter said, in their
defence, that the universal church
was possessed of their cause, by the
appeal which they had made to a
future council; and that, ‘till the decision
which they waited for, they
could not be cast out of her bosom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
It was replied, that a crowd
of hereticks, to begin with Pelagius,
so odious to the modern Jansenists, had
been looked upon and treated as innovators,
without having been condemned
expressly by any œcumenical
council. They objected, that the
bull proposed in reality not one truth
for belief; the accumulated qualifications
of <i>hereticks</i>, <i>smelling</i> of <i>heresy</i>,
of <i>ill sounding</i>, of <i>offending pious ears</i>,
&amp;c. were not applied to any one proposition
of father Quesnel’s in particular.
Some of their adversaries,
after the example of an illustrious
chief of Israel<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>,
replied to them,
(making a jest probably both of them
and the bull) that it proposed “to
believe with an implicit faith indeterminate
truths:” others said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
simply, that in a list of poisons, it
was not necessary to mark expressly
the degree of malignity of each, in
order to warn people to abstain from
them. It was demanded again of
the Jansenists, how the church could
preserve one of her essential characters,
that of being <i>visible</i>, if she were
reduced to a handful of priests, opposed
to all the other pastors? And
they replied, that the true church,
the <i>visible</i> church, was that which
taught <i>visibly</i> sound doctrine, and
which did not authorise, like the bull,
the most shocking Pelagianism: they
added, that the church, <i>visible</i> as
she is, and must be, was not the less
hid in appearance in those unhappy
times, when the fathers of the
church assure us that the whole universe
“was astonished to see itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Arian.” In a word, the Jansenists
answered their adversaries, as Sertorius
did Pompey,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">Rome n’est plus dans Rome; elle est toute où je
	     suis.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It was thus that the one and the
other defended their cause. We say
nothing of the ill language which
they added to them, and which on
either side were worthy of their
reasons.</p>

<p>The magistrates alone (and this
observation is not to be neglected)
opposed, on this occasion, to the constitutionists,
reasons that were unanswerable:
they pronounced, that
the doctrine, taught or authorised by
the bull, was contrary to the laws
of the kingdom, and of consequence
ought not to be a pretext for vexation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Of this the magistrates were
competent judges, and the partisans
of the bull had nothing to
reply: it belongs to the depositaries
of the law to decide what is
conformable or contrary to it; and
this question is not within the province
of the church.</p>

<p>It is certain, besides, that all those
refusals of the sacraments, occasioned
by the bull, disturbed private families;
that they sowed dissension among the
people: that in this view, at least, the
magistrates ought to take cognizance
of it, and to employ, as they did, the
authority of the laws, to put an end
to the confusion. But the inconvenience
which attends contests in
theology, of hurting the publick
tranquillity, is the fruit of the error
which was committed in France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and almost every where else, of connecting
civil affairs with religion, of
requiring a citizen of Paris to be,
not only a faithful subject, but also a
good catholic, and as exact in providing
holy bread as in paying his
taxes. As long as this spirit shall
subsist among us, the maxim of which
fanaticks make an ill use so often,
“That it is better to obey God than
man,” will be an invincible obstacle
to the most prudent measures of
government and of magistrates for
stifling religious quarrels; because
men like better to obey a master
of their own chusing (and who, after
all, commands them to do only what
they please) than a master whom
they have not chosen, and who enjoins
them what they dislike. In
Holland, where the Jansenists form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
a church absolutely separate, which
the government knows nothing of,
and leaves in peace, they are neither
the cause nor the object of any disturbance.
It is only by a discreet
toleration (equally avowed by religion
and politicks) that we can prevent
those frivolous disputes from being
contrary to the repose of the state,
and to the union of the subject. But
when shall we see that happy time?</p>

<p>However this be, the Jansenists,
treated at their death as excommunicated
persons, rose up against this
new persecution. The parliament,
which had registered the bull with
a very ill will, undertook their defence;
it banished the fathers who
refused the communion to dieing
Jansenists: the archbishop, on
his side, forbad them, and deprived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of their places those priests who
obeyed the parliament; and the unhappy
<i>God-Bearers</i> (so they are called)
having before their eyes exile on one
side, and famine on the other, found
themselves under a melancholy alternative.
Reasonable people were
surprised that the archbishop, the
author of their misfortune, did not
go and present himself to the parliament,
declare that they had done nothing
but by his orders, and give
himself up as a victim for so many
innocents. They had so much the
more reason to expect this, as the virtue
of that prelate, and his sincerity
in this affair, were by no means suspected.
The Jansenists called him
persecutor and schismatick; the
courtiers, obstinate: his partisans
compared him to St. Athanasius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
who was also (they said) called obstinate
and rebellious by the courtiers
of his time.</p>

<p>The dispute grew more and more
warm: the court wished ineffectually
to put a stop to it; the Jansenists
had found means to occasion
more trouble in their deaths than they
had done during their lives; the parliaments
and the arch-bishop were
exiled by turns. At last the king,
justly tired of these disputes, recalled
the magistrates, and in concert
with them imposed alike silence on
the partisans and on the adversaries
of the bull.</p>

<p>This law of silence, it is true, was
not too well observed; it was particularly
broken by the encomiums
which the Jansenists bestowed on it:
they printed large volumes to prove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
that it was necessary to be silent; they
resembled the Pedant in Moliere,
who after having talked a long
time, and said abundance of foolish
things, promises at last to keep
silence<a name="FNanchor_13_13"
id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>,
and in order to shew that
he maintains his promise, interrupts
every moment the conversation,
by observing <i>that he opens not his
mouth</i>.</p>

<p>The constitutionists on their side
had the presumption to say, that the
King had no right to ordain mad
subjects to be silent on the ridiculous
object which heated their
imaginations; that the sixth general
council had <i>anathematized</i> the <i>type</i> of
the emperor Constantius, which was
also, as they pretended, nothing more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
than a <i>law of silence</i>. The Jansenists
replyed, that this council had
done better still, in <i>anathematizing</i>
Pope Honorius.</p>

<p>The King, employed like a good
father, according to the expression of
a celebrated author, in parting his
children who were fighting, was
desirous of supporting himself by
an authority respectable to both
parties, and especially to the most
numerous: he thought proper to
consult on this question, by which
all France was agitated, the late pope
Benedict XIV. a man of understanding,
who loved not the Jesuits,
and who at the bottom despised this
controversy. The pope replied like a
crafty Italian; on one side he ordained
the acceptance of the bull, the work
of one of his <i>infallible</i> predecessors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
which he could not decently condemn;
on the other, he declared
at the same time, that the Jansenists
who rejected it, ought nevertheless
to have the sacraments administered
to them at their deaths, “but
at their own risque and hazard,”
and after having been <i>thoroughly advertized</i>
of the danger which they
ran with respect to their eternal
salvation. From this period
the refusals of the sacraments became
less frequent; the Jansenists
and their adversaries thought they
had alike the pope for them, and
tranquillity seemed almost re-established.</p>

<p>It was not even lessened by the
step which the parliament thought
itself obliged to take some time after,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of protesting anew against this bull
<i>Unigenitus</i>; the acceptance of which
it had registered with reluctance. It
called not in question indeed the doctrine
of the bull; that would have
been to encroach on the authority of
the church, and it knew too well
the limits of its own rights: it protested
only against the execution of
this bull, declaring it contrary to what
is termed in France “the liberties
of the Gallican Church.” This
protest had not the glory it merited;
it was the sequel of a number of
writings, of which the French levity
began to be tired. Nay, the partisans
of the bull even made a jest, with an
indecency that deserved punishment,
of the “pretended liberties of the Gallican
Church,” by virtue of which,
the parliament, according to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
terms of its decrees, enjoined the
priests, under ignominious penalties,
to administer the sacraments: they
saw not, said they jeeringly, how such
decrees supported and favoured the
liberty of the church of France, by
forcing its ministers to do what they
did not think they ought to do. This
way of talking, these contests, the
pieces without number, which resulted
from them, served to feed the
frivolous disposition and gaiety of
the nation: people laughed at the reciprocal
animosity of the theologists
of both parties, for questions which
deserved it so little: for that animosity,
though very usual, and of all ages,
always astonishes and amuses reasonable
people. Every body laughed no less
at seeing, that notwithstanding the reiterated
orders issued by the Sorbonne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to mention no more of the bull <i>Unigenitus</i>,
either in their writings or their
theses, the college displayed an attachment
the most obstinate to this bull,
which it had rejected so long. Nothing
more was wanting, it was said, to all
the strange things that had happened
on this subject, than to forbid without
success the faculty of divinity from
teaching a doctrine which it cost so
much trouble to make them receive.
Philosophy, above all, laughed in
silence at all these extravagancies, and
amused herself with this new change
of the scene, waiting with patience for
an opportunity of profiting by it.
Those among the philosophers who
hoped for no good from these quarrels,
took the still wiser part, of laughing at
the whole. They observed the mutual
rancour of the Jansenists and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
adversaries, with that disinterested
curiosity with which they observe the
combats of animals, well assured, let
what would happen, of ending cause
to laugh at the expence of some of
them. So many blows reciprocally
struck on both sides with violence,
did not yet reach the Jesuits; employed
on one hand in arming the bishops
against the expiring remains of
the Jansenists their enemies; and on
the other, in animating, underhand,
the court of France against
the parliaments, they were the secret
soul of all this war, without appearing
to intermeddle in it. But the
Jansenists, who, in the quarrel concerning
the sacraments, had, or at
least thought they had, gained
ground, grew bolder by degrees,
seemed to prepare for a more decisive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
stroke; and the arch-bishop, their
enemy, whetted, without knowing it,
by his zeal, the sword with which the
society was soon to be pierced.</p>

<p>Two capital errors which the Jesuits
committed about that time at
Versailles, began to shake their credit,
and to prepare from afar their
disaster. They refused, as we are assured,
through motives of human
respect, to take under their direction
some powerful personages<a name="FNanchor_14_14"
id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>,
who had
no reason to expect from them a severity
so singular in many respects.
This indiscreet refusal, it is said, contributed
to hasten their ruin by the
very hands which they might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
made their support: thus these
men, who had been so often accused
of loose morals, and who had
maintained themselves at court by
such morals alone, were undone
the moment that they wanted (even
to their own great regret) to profess
severity; an abundant subject
for reflexions, and an evident proof
that the Jesuits, from the very first
till that time, had taken the right
way to support themselves, seeing
they ceased to be, the moment that
they deviated from it. It is added,
that at the same time that they displeased
the court by their scruples,
they displeased it also by their intrigues.
They laid, it was said, snares
for some men in place, whose crime
in their eyes was that of being wanting
in devotion to the society, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
only country which they know: the
usual effect of these sorts of attacks
is, to strengthen the credit which they
do not overthrow; those who were the
objects of the Jesuitical plots obtained
but the more favour by that means.</p>

<p>While the Jesuits, rather dreaded
than supported by the greater part of
the clergy, animated against themselves
the parliaments, and alienated
the persons of the court who had
most credit, they also found the
secret to indispose greatly a set of
men, less powerful in appearance,
but more formidable than is imagined,
that of the men of letters.
Their declamations, at court and in
the city, against the <i>Encyclopedie</i> had
irritated against them all those who
wished well to that work, and who
were very numerous: their invectives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
against the author of the
<i>Henriade</i>, their old pupil, and for a
long time their friend, had provoked
that celebrated writer, who made
them sensibly feel the folly which
they had been guilty of in attacking
him. Whatever be our strength, or
whatever we imagine it to be, we
ought never to make ourselves enemies
of those who, enjoying the advantage
of being read from one end
of Europe to the other, are able, with
one stroke of their pen, to inflict a
signal and lasting vengeance. This
is a maxim which favour and power
itself ought never to make either
individuals, or societies, lose sight
of, but which the Jesuits of our
times seem to have forgot to their
great misfortune. The lion pretends
to sleep, suffers the wasp to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
buz around his ears; but grows
tired at last of hearing it, rouses
himself, and kills it. For six years
and upwards, the Journalists de Trevoux,
and the light troops which
low literature maintained in their
pay, abused the celebrated person
above mentioned, who seemed not to
know it, and suffered them to go on.
At length tired of seeing himself harrassed
by so many insects, he tucked up
the maroders, and silenced their chiefs;
and what is of importance in France
to the gaining of a cause, exposed
both the one and the other to publick
laughter. While he rendered
the Jesuits ridiculous, they rendered
themselves odious to all the sensible
men of the nation, by the spirit of
persecution which they preached up
in the same Journal de Trevoux, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the fanaticism which they published in
it. The philosophers, as they are called,
whom they sought to maltreat,
forgot, on their side, no opportunity
of avenging themselves in their works;
and this they did in a manner the
most mortifying to the Jesuits, without
too much engaging and exposing
themselves. They did not say to
them as the Jansenists did, “You are
ambitious, intriguing, and knaves:”
this accusation would not have humbled
the society: they said to them,
“You are blockheads; you have
not among you a single man of
learning, whose name is famous
in Europe, and worthy of
being so: you boast of your credit;
but that credit exists more in opinion
than in reality; it is only a
house of cards, which will be overturned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the moment one blows upon
it.” They said true, and the
event has proved it. To complete
their misfortune, the Jesuits, overwhelmed
with the blows which
they had imprudently drawn upon
themselves, had not one single defender
able to repel them: they had
no good writers, nor men of merit
in any kind; their new enemies,
oppressed by them at Versailles, were
too strong for them at the pen; and
the value of this advantage is sensibly
felt in a nation which loves to read
only to amuse itself, and which ends
always by declaring for that party
which succeeds therein the best. The
Jesuits had for them the phantom of
their power; their adversaries had
France and all Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be confessed that the Jansenists,
who never piqued themselves
on being artful, were much more
so in these latter times, than they
thought for; and that the Jesuits,
who value themselves greatly on
their finesse, were not at all cunning.
They fell like fools into the
snare which their enemies had laid
for them, without once suspecting
it. The Jansenist Gazetteer,
excited only by fanaticism and hatred
(for that half-witted satyrist
knew no better) reproached the
Jesuits with pursuing in the Jansenists
the phantom of heresy, and of
not falling upon the philosophers,
who became daily, according to him,
more numerous and more insolent.
The Jesuits stupidly quitted their
expiring prey, to attack men full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
vigour, who never thought of hurting
them. What was the consequence?
They have not quieted their
old enemies, and have drawn upon
themselves new ones, whom they had
nothing to do with. They perceive it
very plainly now, but it is too late.</p>

<p>Such was the situation of these fathers,
when the war kindled between
England and France brought upon
the society that famous law-suit
which ended in its destruction: the
Jesuits carried on a trade with
Martinico; the war having occasioned
them some losses, they wanted
to break their correspondents at
Lyons and Marseilles; a Jesuit in
France, to whom these correspondents
addressed themselves for justice, talked
to them like the <i>rat retired from the
world</i>: “My friends,” said the recluse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
“things below no longer concern
me; and what can a poor hermit
assist you in? What can he do but
pray God to help you in this
affair? I hope that he will take
some care of you.<a name="FNanchor_15_15"
id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>”</p>

<p>He offered to say a mass for them to
obtain from God, instead of the money
which they demanded, the grace to
bear in a <i>Christian-like</i> manner their
ruin. These merchants, thus robbed
and treated like fools by the Jesuits,
attacked them in the regular way of
justice; they pretended that these fathers,
by virtue of their constitutions,
were answerable one for the other,
and that the Jesuits in France ought
to discharge the debts of their missionaries
in America. The Jesuits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
were so persuaded of the goodness
of their cause, that as they had a
right to be judged before the Great
Council, they demanded, in order to
render their triumph more brilliant
and complete, to have the cause
brought before the Great Chamber
of the parliament of Paris. They lost
it there unanimously, and to the
great satisfaction of the publick,
which testified its joy at it by universal
applause: they were condemned
to pay immense sums to the parties,
with a prohibition to them to meddle
with commerce.</p>

<p>This was but the beginning of
their misfortunes. In the law-suit
which they maintained, it had been
debated, whether in reality, by
their constitutions, they were answerable
one for the other: this question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
furnished the parliament with a very
natural opportunity of demanding a
sight of those famous constitutions,
which had never been either examined
or approved of with the requisite
forms. The examination of
these constitutions, and afterward that
of their books, furnished <i>legal</i> means
more than sufficient for declaring
their institution contrary to the laws
of the kingdom, to the obedience
due to the sovereign, to the security
of his person, and to the tranquillity
of the state.</p>

<p>I say <i>legal</i> means; for we ought
to distinguish, in this cause, the <i>legal</i>
means on which the destruction of
the Jesuits was founded, from the
other motives, no less equitable, of
that destruction. We must not believe,
that either the constitutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of these fathers, or the doctrine they
are reproached with, were the only
cause of their ruin, though they
may be the only truly <i>legal</i> cause,
and the only one of course which
should have been mentioned in the
decrees issued against them. It is
but too true, that several other orders
have nearly for principle the same
servile obedience which the Jesuits
vow to their superiours, and to the
pope; it is but too true, that a thousand
other doctors and religious orders
have taught the doctrine of the
power of the church over the temporalities
of kings: it was not
merely because they thought the Jesuits
worse Frenchmen than other
monks, that they destroyed and dispersed
them: it was because they
looked upon them with reason as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
more to be dreaded on account of
their intrigues and their credit; and
this motive, though not <i>legal</i>, is certainly
a much better one than was necessary
to get rid of them. The national
league against the Jesuits resembles
that of Cambray against the republick
of Venice, which had for its principal
cause the riches and insolence of
those republicans. The society had
furnished the same motives for hatred.
The publick were justly displeased
at seeing persons of a religious
order, devoted by their very profession
to humility, to retirement and
silence, directing the consciences of
kings, educating the gentry, caballing
at court, in the city, and in
the provinces. Nothing irritates reasonable
people more, than men who
have renounced the world, and yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
seek to govern it. This, in the
eyes of the wise, was the least pardonable
crime of the society: this
crime, of which no mention was
made, was of greater weight than
all those they were loaded with besides,
and which, by their nature,
were more proper to cause a decree
to be pronounced against them in a
court of judicature.</p>

<p>The Jesuits have even had the presumption
to pretend, and several
bishops their partisans have dared to
declare it in print, that the great
collection of assertions, extracted
from the Jesuit authors by order
of the parliament, a collection
which served as the principal motive
for their destruction, ought not to
have had that effect: that it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
compiled in haste by Jansenist
priests, and ill-attested by magistrates
who were unfit for the
work: that it was full of false
quotations, passages that were mutilated
or misunderstood, objections
that were taken for answers: in
short, of a thousand other unfair
things of the like nature. The magistrates
took the trouble of replying
to these reproaches, and the publick
would have excused them: it cannot
be denied, that amidst a great number
of exact quotations, some errors had
escaped: they were acknowledged
without difficulty. But could these
errors (though they had been much
more numerous) prevent the rest
from being true? Besides, were
the complaint of the Jesuits and
their defenders as just as it appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to be otherwise, who will give
himself the trouble of examining
so many passages? In the mean time,
till the truth be cleared up (if truths
of this nature be worth the trouble)
this collection will have produced the
good which the nation desired, the
annihilation of the Jesuits; the reproaches
with which we have a right
to upbraid them will be more or
less numerous; but the society will
not exist; that was the important
point.</p>

<p>This volume of assertions, extracted
from the books of the Jesuits,
condemned by the magistrates, had
been preceded some years before by
the condemnation of the work of
the Jesuit Busenbaum, in which the
doctrine of king-killing is openly
maintained: the copy on which this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
condemnation was pronounced, bore
date 1757, the melancholy æra of
that attempt which filled France with
horrour and consternation. The Jesuits
have pretended that this date
was a forgery of their enemies, who,
to render them odious, had caused a
new title-page to be prefixed to an
old edition: the Jansenists maintained,
that the edition was in reality
quite new, and proved in a sensible
manner how far, and to what a degree
of impudence, the Jesuits dared
be bad subjects. These Jansenists,
so little dexterous in other matters,
but very violent and rancorous, had
actually persuaded the greater part
of the French nation, that the atrocious
crime in question was the
work of the Jesuits. However, the
answers of the criminal to the interrogatories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
put to him, as they
were made publick, by no means
accused those fathers; but he had
been a servant to them, as well as to
persons of the opposite party: he had
declared this to his judges; the Jesuits
(for good reasons without doubt, but
which we are ignorant of) were not
interrogated, as it seemed they should
have been; this was enough to a great
part of the publick, to charge them
with the crime.</p>

<p>The assassination of the king of
Portugal, which happened the year
following, and in which the society
was again involved, served as a new
means to its enemies for maintaining,
and making it believed, that the attempt,
which shocked all France, was
their work. The friends of the Jesuits
pretended that they were innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of the crime committed in
Portugal; that the storm raised
against them on this occasion, and of
which also they became the victims
in that kingdom, was an effect of the
hatred which they had drawn upon
them, on the part of the prime minister
Carvalho, who was all-powerful
with that prince. But why should
persons of a religious order inspire a
minister of state with hatred against
them, unless it be because they have
rendered themselves formidable to
that minister by their intrigues?
Why should Mr. Carvalho, who detested
the Jesuits, leave in peace the
Cordeliers, the Jacobins, and the
Recollects, unless because he found
the Jesuits in his way, and that the
others vegetated in peace in their convents,
without doing the state either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
good or harm? Every religious and
turbulent society merits, on that account
alone, that a state should be
purged of them; it is a crime for
them to be formidable.</p>

<p>Accordingly the Portugueze minister
availed himself dexterously of
the imputation laid to the charge of
some of these fathers, of having advised,
directed, and absolved the assassins,
for causing all the Jesuits to be
driven out of the kingdom: they
were sent to their general, who, it is
said, not knowing what to do with
these new-comers, left them to perish
with hunger and want on board the
very vessels which brought them.</p>

<p>M. de Carvalho, when he expelled
the Jesuits, caused three of them
to be arrested, who had been declared
guilty; but he was not powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
enough to procure the Jesuit Malagrida
to be put to death, though
he passed for the most criminal. The
Portugueze populace, ignorant, superstitious,
and full of Romish maxims,
would not have suffered a religious
to be delivered up to the secular arm
for a crime deserving of the greatest
punishments, because that crime was
committed only against a layman:
they were obliged, in order to convict
Malagrida of a crime against God,
which should render him worthy of
death, to go and seek out some silly
books of devotion, the productions
of weakness and of madness, written
by that unhappy Jesuit: it was solely
for these rhapsodies that he was
condemned to the fire of the inquisition,
not as guilty of high treason,
but as a heretick. They reproached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
him with visions and miracles, of
which he had had the folly to boast;
they reproached him particularly
with having been able, at the age of
seventy-five years, to divert himself
all alone in his confinement as a
young novice would have done;
which might also have been looked
upon as a kind of miracle, truely
worthy of being counted among the
others. It was upon motives of this
sort that he was condemned to a
most cruel death: the arrêt did not
even make mention of the parricide
of which he was accused; and as
M. de Voltaire most excellently remarks,
an excess of severity was joined
to an excess of folly.</p>

<p>It was matter of pleasantry to observe
the embarrassment into which
the Jesuits and the Jansenists were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
thrown, on account of this victim
sacrificed to the inquisition. The
Jesuits, devoted till that time to this
bloody tribunal, dared no longer take
its part, since it had burnt one of
their society: the Jansenists who abhorred
it, began to think it just,
from the moment that it had condemned
a Jesuit to the flames. They
assured us, and asserted it in print,
that the inquisition was not what
they had thought it till then, and
that justice was done there <i>with
much wisdom and deliberation</i>. Some
magistrates also, till then sworn enemies
of the inquisition, seemed at
this juncture to soften a little towards
it. One of the first tribunals in the
kingdom condemned to the fire a
writing, in which the Portugueze inquisition
was very ill treated on account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of the punishment of Malagrida:
and in the declaration which
condemned this writing to the fire,
they bestowed many commendations,
not wholly on the inquisition itself,
but on the <i>scrupulous examination</i> in
consequence of which the Jesuit was
delivered up to the secular arm.</p>

<p>On account of this charge of regicide,
so often renewed against the
Jesuits, we shall relate here a curious
anecdote. It is astonishing, that
among so many pieces which have
called these fathers <i>assassins</i>, not one
has made mention of a circumstance
indeed little known, but which seems
to afford a fine light to their enemies.
At Rome, in their church of St.
Ignatius, they have caused to be represented
in the four corners of the
cupola (painted about a hundred years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
since by one of their fathers) subjects
drawn from the Old Testament; and
these subjects are so many assassinations,
or at least murders, committed
in the name of God by the Jewish
people: Jael, who, impelled by the
Divine Spirit, drives a nail into Sisera’s
head, to whom she had offered
and given hospitality; Judith, who,
conducted by the same guide, cuts
off the head of Holofernes, after having
seduced and made him drunk;
Sampson, who massacres the Philistines
by order of the Almighty;
lastly, David, who slays Goliah. At
the top of the cupola, St. Ignatius,
in a glory, darts out flames on the
four quarters of the world, with
these words of the New Testament;
“I came to set fire to the earth;
and what would I but that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
be kindled?” Methinks, if any
thing could make known the spirit
of the society, with respect to the
murderous doctrine that is imputed
to them, these pictures would be a
stronger proof of it than all the passages
which are related from their
authors, and which are common to
them with many others: but the
truth is, that these principles, supported
in appearance by the scriptures ill understood,
are the principles of the fanaticks
of all ages; and we may add,
of the greater part of any sect, when
they believe it to be their interest to
propagate them, and that they can
preach them in safety. To them an
heretick and infidel prince is a tyrant,
and of course a man whom religion
and reason order us equally to
rid ourselves of. The only thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
which the Jesuits ought to be reproached
with, is that of having forsaken
these abominable principles
later than others, after having more
strongly maintained them; of making
particular profession of obedience
to the pope, and of a stricter obedience
than the other orders; of being,
on this account, so much the more
to be dreaded in the state, the
more they are in credit there, the
more dispersed, the more addicted to
the ecclesiastical function, and above
all to the instruction of youth; of
never having expressed themselves
frankly and clearly (when they have
not been forced to it) on the maxims
of government, touching the infallibility
of the pope, and the independence
of kings; and of having
given too much room to understand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
that they looked upon these maxims
as mere local opinions, which might
be maintained either pro or con, according
to the country in which they
found themselves placed. We may
say with truth, and without passion,
that this manner of thinking breaks
forth in all their works, and in those
even of the French Jesuits, who have
wanted to appear less Romish with
respect to our maxims, than their
brethren of Italy or Spain.</p>

<p>We must not believe, however,
that this submission to the pope, with
which the society are so often reproached,
is with them an irrevocable
doctrine. While the Jesuits
preached it in Europe with so much
zeal, we may say with  madness, to
effect the acceptance of the bull
which they had drawn up, they opposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in China the decrees which
the sovereign pontiffs launched out
against them on account of the Chinese
ceremonies: they went even so
far, as to call in question the pope’s
authority to decide on subjects of
that nature. So far it is true, that
their pretended devotion to the pope
was only, as we may say, by way of
<i>inventorial benefit</i>, and on the tacit
condition of favouring their pretensions,
or at least of not prejudicing
their interests.</p>

<p>However this be, the parallel
which has just been made of the
doctrine of the Jesuits with the other
orders, is, in my opinion, the true
point of view from which we should
have set out in their destruction.
Among so many magistrates, who
have written long examinations on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the affair of the society, M. de la
Chalotais, attorney-general of the
parliament of Bretagne, appears more
than any other to have considered
this affair like a statesman, a philosopher,
an enlightened magistrate,
and one disengaged of all spirit of
hatred and of party. He has not
amused himself with proving laboriously
and weakly, that the other
monks were better than the Jesuits:
he has penetrated farther and deeper:
his march to the fight has been more
frank and firm. “The monastick
spirit,” said he, “is the scourge of
states: of all those whom this spirit
animates, the Jesuits are the
most hurtful, because they are the
most powerful; it is then with
them that we must begin to shake
off the yoke of that pernicious race.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
It seems as if this illustrious magistrate
had taken for his device the
following verses of Virgil<a name="FNanchor_16_16"
id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">Ductoresque ipsos primùm, capita alta ferentes</div>
       <div class="verse">Cornibus arboreis, sternit; tum vulgus,
	     &amp; omnem</div>
       <div class="verse">Miscet agens telis nemora inter frondea turbam.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The war which he has made with
so much success upon the society, is
only the signal of the examination to
which he appears desirous of having
the constitutions of the other orders
submitted, with a proviso of preserving
those, which on such examination
shall be judged useful. There
are even some particular communities,
for example, that of the fraternity
called <i>Ignorantins</i>, whom he
points out expressly to the vigilance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the magistrates, as having already
gained silently much ground: however,
I know not whether I am mistaken,
men who bear a name so little
formed to command respect, ought
by no means to flatter themselves
with succeeding one day to the Jesuits,
among a people with whom names
are apt to give law: it is necessary,
in order to have in France success
and enemies, to begin by calling
one’s-self otherwise.</p>

<p>With regard to the other monks
in general, it belongs to the wisdom
of government to judge of the method
they ought to take with them;
but supposing they should one day
want  to destroy them, or at least
to weaken them enough to prevent
their being hurtful, there is an infallible
way of succeeding therein,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
without employing violence, which
must be avoided even with them:
this would be  to  revive the ancient
laws, which forbid monastick vows
before twenty-five years of  age. May
the government yield in this respect
to the unanimous desire of enlightened
citizens!</p>

<p>In expectation of this disaster of
the monastick communities and the
happiness of the state, let us continue
and finish the account of  the
annihilation of the Jesuits. In spite
of the war declared against the society
by the magistrates, those fathers
did not think their destruction
unavoidable: the parliament of
Paris, which had given them the
first blow, had assigned them a year
to judge of their institution: the
party which desired their ruin, blind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
with hatred, and knowing neither
the laws nor its forms, reproached
the parliament with having granted
them so long a term: they were
afraid, that the friends which they
had still left at court, would obtain
from the king an evocation to himself
alone of the judgement of this
affair. These apprehensions appeared
so much the better founded, as, in
the interval of the time assigned for
judgement, they had again received
from court pretty striking marks of
protection. The parliament, by the
arrêt of the 6th of August, 1761,
which adjourned them to appear at
the end of the year for the judgement
of their constitutions, had ordained
provisionally the shutting up of their
college on the first of October following:
the king, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the representations of the parliament,
prorogued this time till the 1st of
April; and this prorogation made it
be apprehended, that they might obtain
marks of favour still more signal.
Nobody moreover could imagine that
a society, lately so powerful, could
ever be annihilated: their very enemies
dared not flatter themselves with
it fully; but they wished at least to
deprive them, if it were possible, of
the two principal branches of their
credit, the place of confessor to their
kings, and the education of the
gentry.</p>

<p>The king, in the midst of all these
proceedings, had consulted, on the
institutes of the Jesuits, the bishops
who were in Paris: about forty
among them, either through persuasion
or policy, had bestowed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
greatest encomiums, both upon the
institute and the society: six were
of opinion, that their constitutions
should be modified in certain respects:
one alone, the bishop of Soissons,
declared the institute and the
order alike detestable. It was pretended
that this prelate (so severe, or
so honest) had personal and very grievous
subjects of complaint against the
Jesuits, who, on a delicate occasion,
had deceived, exposed, and sacrificed
him. Besides resentment, as they
said, and that he wanted to avenge
himself of them, this bishop was become
Jansenist, and declared chief
of a party, which had no longer a
head, and was soon to have no members.
Unhappily for the Jesuits,
the prelate, whom they sought to
cry down, was of an unblemished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
reputation in point of religion, probity,
and manners: he affirmed, without
disguise, that the parliaments
were in the right, and that they
could not too effectually get rid of a
society, equally destructive to religion
and to the state.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a plurality of the
bishops being favourable to the preservation
of the Jesuits, the king,
in order to show deference to their
opinion, issued an edict, the object
of which was to suffer them to subsist,
modifying, in several respects,
their constitutions. This edict being
carried to  the parliament to be
registered, met there a general opposition:
they made strong remonstrances
against it; and these remonstrances
had more success than the
parliament itself could have expected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
The king, without making any reply
to them, withdrew his edict.</p>

<p>In this situation, Martinico, which
had already been so fatal to these
fathers, by occasioning the law-suit
which they had lost, hastened, it is
said, their ruin, by a singular circumstance.
We received, at the end
of March, 1762, the melancholy
news of the taking of that colony.
This capture, so important to the
English, occasioned a loss of several
millions to our commerce: the wisdom
of the government was desirous
of preventing the complaints which
so great a loss would occasion to the
publick. They bethought them, by
way of causing a diversion, of furnishing
the French with another
subject of conversation; as heretofore
Alcibiades thought of cutting off his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
dog’s tail, in order to prevent the
Athenians from talking of weightier
matters. They declared then to
the principal of the college of the
Jesuits, that nothing more remained
for them but to obey the parliament,
and to put a stop to their lectures, by
the 1st of April, 1762. From that
time the colleges were shut up, and
the society began seriously to despair
of its fortune: at length the 6th of
August, 1762, the day so wished for
by the publick, arrived: the institute
was unanimously condemned by the
parliament, without any opposition
on the part of the sovereign: their
vows were declared not binding, the
Jesuits secularised and dissolved, their
effects alienated and sold; the greater
part of the parliaments, sooner or
later,  treated them pretty nearly in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the same manner; some mingled still
more rigour in their judgements, and
drove them away without other form
of process.</p>

<p>They lived therefore dispersed here
and there, and wearing the secular
habit; but they remained still about
the court, and were even in greater
numbers there than ever: they seemed
there to brave in silence their
enemies, and to wait, in order to recover
themselves, a more favourable
season. It was said pretty loudly,
that these foxes were not destroyed,
if they proceeded not at last to shut
them up in the hole where they
thought themselves secure; and that
they were not martyrs so long as they
were confessors.  “They are very
sick;” it was added, “perhaps dieing,
but their pulse yet beats.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
They were thought to be so little
annihilated, notwithstanding their
dispersion, that a superior of a seminary,
to whom their house for novices
was offered, replied, that he
would not accept of it, out of fear
of <i>spirits</i>.</p>

<p>They were not however very far
distant from the moment of their
total expulsion; and it was again to
the inconsiderate zeal of their friends
that they owed this obligation. A
frantick partisan of the society published,
in their defence, a violent treatise,
abusing the magistrates, entitled, <i>It is Time to Speak</i>. Somebody said
then, that the magistrates answer
should be, <i>It is Time to Depart</i>. Such
person was so much the less mistaken,
as a new subject of complaint succeeded,
to fill up the measure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
these  proceedings. The arch-bishop,
of whom we have already made such
frequent mention, thought the rights
of the church violated by the arrêts
of parliament, against vows contracted
before the altars: he issued, in
favour of the Jesuits, a mandate,
which served completely to set the
magistrates against them; some of
these fathers were accused of having
hawked about the mandate; some
of their votaries, of having  vended it:
this was, as it were, the signal of the
last blow given to the whole body.
The parliament ordered, that  within
the space of eight days, every  Jesuit,
professed or not professed, who was
desirous of remaining in the kingdom,
should make oath that he renounced
the institution. The term
was short; they did not choose to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
give them time to deliberate: it was
feared they might hold secret assemblies
among themselves; that they
might write to their general to beg
his leave to give way to the times;
that by favour of <i>mental restrictions</i>,
they might take the oath which was
required; that under the cover of
this oath they might remain in
France, in order to wait there a
more favourable juncture; that they
might practise at last the maxim of
Acomat in Bajazet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">Promettez; affranchi du péril qui vous presse,</div>
       <div class="verse">Vous verrez de quel poids sera votre promesse.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is certain that the Jesuits, in
signing the oath which was proposed,
would have greatly embarrassed the
Jansenists their enemies, who sought
only a pretext to get them banished,
and to whom that pretext would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
have been wanting. It is certain
moreover, that as Frenchmen and
as Christians they might have signed
conscientiously what was required of
them: this a writer, by no means
well affected in other respects to the
society, has proved demonstratively,
by a writing which has fallen into my
hands, and which will be found in
the sequel of this history: but whether
it was fanaticism or reason,
whether a principle of conscience
or human respect, whether honour
or obstinacy, the Jesuits did not what
they might have done, and what it was
feared they would do. These men,
who were thought so much disposed
to trifle with religion, and who had
been represented as such in a multitude
of writings, refused almost all
to take the oath which was required
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of them: in consequence thereof
they had orders to quit the kingdom;
and these orders were executed with
rigour. In vain several of them represented
their age, their infirmities,
the services which they had performed;
hardly one of their requests was
granted. The justice which had
been done on the body, was pushed
against individuals to an extreme severity,
which probably was thought
necessary. They wanted to take
away from this society, the very
shadow of which seemed to terrify
even after it no longer existed, all
means of springing up again one day;
sentiments of compassion were sacrificed
to what was deemed reason of
state. Nevertheless the implacable
Jansenists, irritated by the very recent
remembrance of the persecutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
which the Jesuits had made them
undergo, thought that the parliament
had not yet done enough: they resembled
the Swiss Captain, who ordered
the dead and the dying to be buried
together on the field of battle: it
was represented to him, that some of
the interred still breathed, and begged
only to live:  “Pho,” said he, “if
we were to mind them, there
would not be a dead man among
them.”</p>

<p>It is certain that the greater part
of the Jesuits, those who in that society
(as elsewhere) interfere with
nothing, and who are much more
numerous among them than is imagined,
ought not, had it been possible,
to have been punished for the
faults of their superiors: thousands
of these innocents were confounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
unwillingly with a score of criminals:
nay, further, these innocents were unhappily
the only persons punished,
and the only ones to be pitied; for the
leaders had obtained, by their interest,
pensions which they could enjoy at
their ease, while the multitude sacrificed
remained without bread as well
as without support. All that could be
alledged in favour of the general decree
of expulsion pronounced against these
fathers, was the famous passage of
Tacitus, relative to that law of the
Romans, which condemned to death
all the slaves in a house for the crime
of a single one: <i>habet aliquid ex iniquo
omne magnum exemplum</i>; “every
great example has somewhat unjust
in it.” Thus, in the destruction
of the Templars, a great number
of innocents fell victims to the pride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and insolent riches of their chiefs:
and thus the disorders, of which
the Templars were accused, were
not the only cause of their destruction;
their principal crime was
that of having rendered themselves
odious and formidable. Posterity will
think the same of the judgement
issued against the Jesuits, and of the
exile to which they have been condemned:
they will deem it perhaps
severe, at least in appearance, but
perhaps also will judge it indispensible:
this time alone can decide.</p>

<p>For the rest, independently of the
natural compassion which the aged
Jesuits, or those sick, and without
resource, seemed to claim, and who
after all are men, one would think a
distinction might have been made, in
the oath which was required, between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the professed Jesuits and those who
were not so, between those who had
already renounced the institution and
those who adhered to it still, without
being absolutely tied to it. Allow the
oath to have been required from the
professed  Jesuits, whom they wanted
to get rid of, such a precaution might
have been thought necessary: but was
it necessary to require anything more
of the Jesuits who were not professed,
than a simple promise that
they would not bind themselves to
the institution, or any thing else of
the ex-Jesuits, than a bare declaration
that they had renounced it?
The contrary conduct which was observed,
might have preserved to the society
subjects who were disposed to
quit it, and who were deprived of
every other resource: this rigour also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
might restore to the order, members
which it had already lost.</p>

<p>In proposing these reflexions, I
am very far from disapproving of the
conduct of the magistrates; who for
just reasons, without doubt, thought
it their duty to act otherwise: it is
proper however to remark, that several
parliaments have thought it
their duty, on their parts, to observe
a contrary conduct; after having dissolved
the institution, they have left
the dispersed Jesuits all the rights of
subjects: but is it not to be feared,
said they, that by preserving them
thus in more than one half of the
kingdom, they have left to these men,
who are thought so turbulent, a
means of forming intrigues, so much
the more dangerous as they are concealed?
Once more, time alone can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
inform us which of the judges
have taken the best method in this
affair; whether the one have not
been too rigorous, and whether the
others, in wanting to be less so, have
not buried the fire under the ashes.</p>

<p>Some parliaments besides had pronounced
no sentence against the institution;
and the Jesuits subsisted
still entire in one part of France.
There was room to apprehend, that
at the first signal of rallying, the
<i>dispersed</i> party, suddenly joining the
party <i>united</i>, might form a new society,
even before any should be in
a condition to oppose it. The wisdom,
and the honour also, of government,
seemed to require, that
the law, with regard to the Jesuits,
whatever it was, should be uniform
throughout the kingdom.  These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
views seem to have dictated the
edict, by which the king has just
abolished the society throughout
all France; but permitting, in other
respects, its members to live quietly
in their country, under the eye
and under the protection of the
laws.  May these pacifick intentions
of our august monarch be
crowned with the success which they
merit!</p>

<p>It was without doubt the better to
fulfill these respectable intentions,
that the parliament of Paris, on registering
this new edict, ordained
the Jesuits to reside each in his own
diocese, and to present themselves
every six months before the magistrates
of the place in which they shall
dwell. We know not whether the
Jesuits, who are already withdrawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
into foreign countries, will think
proper to submit to this constraint.
The same arrêt forbids them to
come within ten leagues of Paris,
which banishes them at least six
leagues from Versailles, but prohibits
them not from dwelling at Fontainbleau
and Compiegne, where the
court resides at least three months in
the year.  It was thought, perhaps,
that during so short a space of time,
their intrigues at court would not be
to be dreaded.</p>

<p>On banishing the Jesuits by its first
arrêt, the parliament of Paris had
assigned them pensions for their subsistence:
this mitigation to their exile
appeared to many people a contradiction.
Wherefore, said they,
facilitate a retreat into foreign countries
to subjects reputed dangerous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
apostles of regicide, enemies of the
state, and who, by refusing to renounce
the society, prefer their Italian general
to their lawful sovereign?
There is no cause, however, for
blaming with severity this apparent
contradiction; though we should
disapprove, in logical rigour, of what
it is not our province to decide upon,
we ought still more to excuse it, on
account of the law of nature which
existed before there were Jansenists
and Jesuits. Those who have hampered
themselves in the institution
of the society, did it altogether under
the protection of the publick
faith and the laws: if they have refused
to renounce it, it may be thro’
a delicacy of conscience ever to be
respected, even in men who are
wrong. On sacrificing them to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
necessity which was thought indispensible,
of no longer permitting
Jesuits in France, it would have been
inhuman to deprive them of the necessaries
of life, and to forbid them
even the air which they breathe.
As to the rest, these reflexions, whether
well or ill founded, have no
longer place, from the moment that
the Jesuits are permitted, without
requiring any thing of them, to remain
in the kingdom: after having
deprived the society of its effects, it
is right to furnish its members with
the means of subsisting, inasmuch as
it is thought possible, without inconvenience,
to restore them to the state
to which they belong.</p>

<p>Let us not forget, before we conclude
this narrative, a singular circumstance,
extremely proper to shew,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
in its true point of view, the pretended
concern for religion, with
which several of its ministers seek to
bedeck themselves. Some bishops,
who reside in their dioceses, joined
themselves, by their mandates, to the
archbishop, defender of the Jesuits:
other bishops (who reside not) were
ready to join themselves also. The
parliament made a shew of wanting
to renew, and causing to be observed
with rigour, the ancient laws
respecting residence: these bishops
then were silent, and their menacing
zeal expired on their lips. Disconcerted
and humbled at their impotence
against the enemies of the
Jesuits, they will seek perhaps to indemnify
themselves, by falling upon
the philosophers, whom they accuse,
very unjustly, of having communicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
to the parliament of Paris their
pretended liberty of thinking: even
already some of these prelates, we
are assured, have taken this sad and
feeble revenge; like that wretch,
on whom, as he was passing, a tile
fell from the top of a house, the
roof of which was repairing; and who,
to revenge himself, threw stones up to
the first story, not having strength,
as he said, to throw them higher.</p>

<p>Such has been in this kingdom
the fate of the Jesuits: the circumstances
of their destruction have been
very strange in all respects; the
storm began at a place where it
was expected the least, in Portugal,
the most addicted of all the
countries of Europe to priests and
monks, which appeared not formed
for delivering itself so speedily from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the Jesuits, and still less to set in
that respect the example; their
annihilation in France was prepared
by the rigour which they
assumed in spite of themselves; lastly,
it was consummated by a dying
and abject sect, which has finished,
against all expectation, what an Arnauld,
a Paschal, and a Nicole, would
neither have been able to execute,
nor attempt, nor even to hope. What
more striking example of that inconceivable
fatality which seems to preside
over human affairs, and to bring
them, when we expect it least, to
the point of maturity or destruction?
It would make a fine chapter, to add
to history the great events which have
happened through slender causes.</p>

<p>A well-known writer, speaking in
1759, three years before the destruction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of the Jesuits, of the two parties
which divided the church of
France, said of the most powerful
party, “that it would cease soon to
exist<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a>:” some wanted to make
these words pass for a prophecy;
but as probably the writer aspires
not to the honour of being a prophet,
he will confess that on writing this
sort of prediction, he was very far
from suspecting it was so true. It
was plainly seen, that the party till
then oppressed began to gain ground;
but nobody could foresee to what
a degree it was to oppress, in its
turn, that by which it had been till
then kept under: fine matter to the
enemies of the society, to enforce the
validity of their ordinary commonplace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
sayings, on the Providence of
God in support of what they call
<i>the good cause</i>!</p>

<p>It is not less singular, that the
French nation, at a time when she suffered
her weakness to appear abroad,
by an unsuccessful war, should have
performed this act of vigour at home:
it is true, that on reflexion we shall
find perhaps, in the same principle,
the cause of so much weakness without,
and of such great strength, or, if
you please, of such great fermentation
within: but this political discussion
would carry us too far, and is no
part of our subject.</p>

<p>What is more singular still, is,
that an undertaking, which would
have been thought very difficult, and
even impossible at the beginning of
1761, should have been accomplished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
in less than two years, without noise,
without resistance, and with as little
trouble as they would have had in
destroying the Capuchins and the
Pickpusses. We cannot say of the
Jesuits that their death has been as
brilliant as their life. Nay, if any
thing ought to humble them, it is that
they have perished so pitifully, so
obscurely, without lustre and without
glory. Nothing better discovers
a real weakness, which had only the
appearance of strength. The Jesuits
will say, without doubt, that they
have only executed, and wanted only
to execute, literally the precept of the
gospel; “When they persecute you
in one city, fly into another.” But
why, after having forgot this precept
for two hundred years, have they remembered
it so late?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, what will complete our
astonishment is, that two or three
men only, who would not have
thought themselves destined to effect
such a revolution, should have conceived
and accomplished this great
project: the general impulse given to
the whole body of the magistracy was
their work, and the fruit of their
impetuous activity. Mankind indeed
are seldom led by cold and calm spirits.
Tranquill reason has not, of
herself alone, the warmth so necessary
to enforce her opinions, and
make us enter into her views: she
is content with instructing her age
silently, and without bustle, and to
become afterwards a mere spectatress
of the effect, whether good or bad,
which her lessons shall have produced.
She resembles, if we may use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the comparison, the “old man of the
mountain,” at whose voice the young
people, his disciples, ran to throw
themselves over precipices, but who
took care not to throw himself over.</p>

<p>It is true, that this small number
of men, who set all the tribunals of
the kingdom in motion against the Jesuits,
found the nation favourably disposed
for that fermentation, and eager
to support it by its discourses. We
say <i>by its discourses</i>; for in France all
that the nation can do, is to speak,
right or wrong, for or against, those
who govern: but it must be confessed
also, that the publick cry is
there held in some account. Philosophy,
against which the Jansenists
had declared war almost as hot as
against the company of Jesus, had
made, in spite of them, and happily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
for them, sensible progresses. The
Jesuits, intolerant by system and situation,
were become by it only the
more odious: they were considered,
if I may so say, as the giants of fanaticism;
as the most dangerous enemies
of reason, and as those whom
it imported most to get rid of. The
parliaments, when they began to attack
the society, found this disposition
in all minds. It was properly
philosophy, which by the mouth of
the magistrates, issued the decree
against the Jesuits: Jansenism was
only the sollicitor in it. The nation,
and the philosophers at its
head, wished the annihilation of
these fathers, because they are intolerant,
persecutors, turbulent, and
formidable: the Jansenists desired
it, because the Jesuits maintain <i>versatile grace</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and themselves <i>efficacious
grace</i>. But for this ridiculous scholastick
dispute, and the fatal bull
which was the fruit of it, the society
would perhaps still exist, after having
so often merited destruction, for
causes somewhat more real and more
weighty. But at last it is destroyed,
and reason is avenged.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Qu’importe de quel bras Dieu daigne se servir?</p></div>

<p>To these reflexions we may join
another no less important, and formed
to serve as a lesson to all religious
orders, which may be tempted to
imitate the Jesuits. If those fathers
had been prudent enough to
confine the credit of the society to
what it might draw from the sciences
and letters, that credit would have
been more solid, less envied, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
more durable. It was the spirit of
intrigue and ambition which they
displayed, the oppressions which they
exercised; in one word, their enormous
power (or what was thought
such) and, above all, the insolence
which they joined to it, that ruined
them. There is no believing to
what a height they had carried their
audaciousness lately: the following
is a pretty recent stroke, which will
make them thoroughly known.</p>

<p>Benedict XIV. at the beginning
of his pontificate, accepted the dedication
of a work, which father Norbert
the Capuchin had composed against
the Jesuits; for they were come
to that pass, as to arm even the Capuchins
against them: <i>Tu quoque Brute</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18"
id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
cried a famous satyrist on this occasion.
The pope thought he might
permit Norbert to remain at Rome
under his protection. He had not
the power to do it: the Jesuits took
their measures so well, that in the
end they drove the Capuchin not only
out of the pope’s territories, but even
out of all the Catholick states: he
was obliged to fly to London, and
found not till 1759 an asylum in
Portugal, when the society were
driven from thence: he had the satisfaction,
as he tells us himself, to
assist at the execution of Malagrida,
and to say mass for the repose of his
soul, while they finished burning his
body.</p>

<p>The persecution, so rancorously
carried on by the Jesuits against this
monk, who was protected by Benedict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
XIV. had greatly irritated that
pope against them; he omitted no
opportunity of giving them, on all
occasions, disgust, whenever it was
in his power. The Jansenists even
doubt not but, if he had lived, he
would have availed himself of the
circumstance of their destruction in
Portugal and France, to annihilate
the society: but whatever they may
say, it is not probable that a pope,
be he what he will, should ever forget
so far his own true interests. The
Jesuits are the sovereign Pontif’s Janissaries,
formidable sometimes to
their master, like those of the Ottoman
Porte, but necessary like them
to the support of the empire. It is
the interest of the court of Rome to
curb and to preserve them: Benedict
XIV. had too much sense not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
think so. The Czar Peter, it is
true, broke at one time 40,000 Strelitzes,
who had revolted, though
they were his best soldiers: but the
Czar had twenty millions of subjects,
and could recruit them with other
Strelitzes; whereas the Pope, whose
whole power is supported only by
the spiritual army under his command,
would not be able easily to
recruit it with such soldiers as the
Jesuits, so well disciplined, so devoted
to the church of Rome, and so
formidable to the enemies of the sovereign
Pontif.</p>

<p>It may be asserted with truth, that
Pope Benedict XIV. would have acted
better on such an occasion than his
successor Clement XIII. He would
not, like the latter, have written to a
king, who did him the honour of consulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
him, “that the Jesuits must remain as they were:” he would
have returned an equivocal answer,
as he did on occasion of the refusal
of the sacraments to the Jansenists;
he would have gained time; he
would have granted the parliaments
some modifications in regard to the
institution (at least with respect to
the French Jesuits); he would have
flattered and engaged the Jansenists,
by some bull, in favour of <i>efficacious
grace</i>: in short, he would have deadened
or weakened the blows that
were aimed at his regiment of guards.
But it looks as if, in this affair, the
Jesuits and their friends had been
seized with a fit of giddiness, and
that they did themselves all that was
necessary to accelerate their ruin:
they shewed themselves, for the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
time, inflexible in a matter, where
it was of the highest importance to
them not to be so: they caballed in
secret, and talked openly at court
against their enemies: they cried
out, that religion was undone, if we
parted with them; that we drove
them away only to establish in France
incredulity and heresy: and by these
means they cast oil on the fire, instead
of extinguishing it. It looks
as if the Jansenists had put up to
God, for the destruction of the society,
the following prayer of Joad
in Athalia.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">Daigne, daigne, grand Dieu, sur <i>son
	     chef</i> &amp; sur elle</div>
       <div class="verse">Répandre cet esprit d’imprudence &amp; d’erreur,</div>
       <div class="verse">De <i>leur destruction</i> funeste avant-coureur.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Accordingly the Jansenists strongly
assured us in their bigotted language,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
that the <i>finger of God</i> was manifest on
all parts in this affair: “Alas!” replied
a quondam Jesuit, seemingly
consoled at being no longer of the
order, “you may say, all his four fingers, and the thumb too!”</p>

<p>Thus then was this famous society
cut off from amidst us; heaven grant
that it may be without return, were
it only for the sake of peace, and that
we may at last be able to say, <i>hic
jacet</i>. Its best friends (we are not
afraid to assert it) are too good subjects
to think the contrary: the re-establishment
of this turbulent, irritated,
and fanatical society, would do
more hurt to the state, than it could,
in the opinion even of its own partisans,
do good to the church. This event
(if Providence please to make it durable)
will form not only an epoch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
but, according to many people, a
true chronological æra in the history
of religion: dates will be reckoned
henceforth in that history from the
<i>Jesuitical Hegira</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19"
id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, at least in Portugal
and in France; and the Jansenists
hope, that this new <i>ecclesiastical
computation</i> will not be long before
it be admitted into other Catholic
countries. This is the end of those
fervent prayers which they put up to
God for the greatest good of their
enemies, and for bringing about
“the return of the society to itself.”</p>

<p>Nothing will be, without doubt,
more advantageous and more pleasing
to them. It is well known that
every Jansenist, provided he can say,
with the savages in Candide, “Let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
us have a slice of the Jesuit,” will
be at the summit of his happiness and
joy: but it remains to know what
profit reason (which is full as good as
Jansenism) will derive at last from a
proscription so greatly desired. I say
<i>reason</i>, and not <i>irreligion</i>: this is a
precaution necessary to be taken; for
the theology of the Jansenists is, as
we have seen, so reasonable, that they
are apt to consider the words <i>reason</i>
and <i>irreligion</i> as synonimous. It is
certain that the annihilation of the
society may be productive of great advantages
to reason, provided the intolerant
spirit of Jansenism succeed not in
credit to Jesuitical intolerance; for we
are not afraid to say that, between
these two sects, both which are wicked
and pernicious, if we were obliged
to choose, and supposing them to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
invested with the same degree of
power, the society, which has just
been expelled, would be still the least
tyrannical. The Jesuits, a complaisant
set of people, provided we declare
ourselves not their enemies, give sufficient
permission to think as we please.
The Jansenists, devoid of consideration
as well as abilities, will have us
think just as they do: if they were
masters, they would exercise over our
writings, over our understandings,
over our discourses, the most violent
inquisition. Happily it is not much
to be feared, that they will ever
acquire much credit: the rigor which
they profess will not make its way
at court, where folks are very desirous
of being Christians, but on
condition that it cost them little;
and their doctrine of Predestination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and Grace is too harsh and too absurd
not to shock their minds.
Let foreigners reproach France as
much as they will (it is of small
importance) on the little concern she
seems to take in her national theatre,
so esteemed throughout all Europe,
and on the distinguished favour which
she bestows on her musick, though
despised by all nations: those foreigners,
envious of us and our
enemies, will not surely ever have
the melancholy advantage of reproaching
our government with a
more material fault, that of taking,
for the object of its protection, men
without talents, without understanding,
unknowing and unknown; after
having heretofore carried, on a
violent persecution against the illustrious
and respectable fathers of so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
pitiful a posterity. Furthermore,
the nation, which begins now to be
enlightened, will probably grow enlightened
more and more. Disputes
concerning religion will be despised,
and fanaticism will be held in horror.
The magistrates, who proscribed the
fanaticism of the Jesuits, are men of
too much understanding, too good
subjects, too much fitted for the age
they live in, to suffer another fanaticism
to succeed it: even already some
of them (among others Mr. de la
Chalotais) have explained themselves
so openly as to displease the Jansenists,
and to merit the honour of
being placed by them in the rank
of philosophers. That sect seems
to say like God, whose language
it so often and so abusively makes
use of, “He that is not for me is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
against me:” but it will not thereby
make the more proselytes. The
Jesuits were regular troops, bred
and disciplined under the standard
of superstition: they were the Macedonian
phalanx, which it imported
reason to see broken and destroyed.
The Jansenists are only
Cossacks and Pandours, of whom
reason will have a cheap conquest,
seeing they will fight singly and dispersed.
In vain will they cry out as
usual, that it is sufficient to shew an attachment
to religion, to be reviled
by <i>modern philosophers</i>. It will be replied
to them, that Paschal, Nicole,
Bossuet, and the writers of the Port-Royal,
were attached to religion;
and that there is not one <i>modern philosopher</i>
(at least, one worthy of that
name) who does not revere and honour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
them. In vain will they imagine,
that because they succeeded to
the Jansenism of Port-Royal, they
are to succeed also to the respect
which it enjoyed: it is as if the valets
de chambre of a great lord should
want to make themselves be styled
his heirs, because they inherited a few
of his cast clothes. Jansenism, in
the Port-Royal, was a blemish which
it effaced by great merit: in its pretended
successors it is their sole existence;
and what, in the age wherein
we live, is an existence so poor and
ridiculous?</p>

<p>Accordingly it need not be doubted
but the destruction of their enemies
will soon bring on theirs, not
with violence, but by slow degrees, by
insensible transpiration, and through
a necessary consequence of the contempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
with which that sect inspires
all sensible people. The Jesuits,
driven out by them, and dragging
them along with themselves in their
fall, may put up, from this instant, to
their founder St. Ignatius, the following
prayer for their enemies,
“Father, pardon them, for they
know not what they do.”</p>

<p>To speak seriously, and without
circumlocution, it is time that the
laws should lend reason their aid for
the annihilation of that party-spirit,
which has so long disturbed the kingdom
with ridiculous controversies;
controversies, we are not afraid to
assert it, more fatal to the state than
infidelity itself, when it seeks not
to make proselytes. A great prince,
it is said, reproached one of his officers
with being a Jansenist or Molinist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
I know not which: they told
him he was mistaken, for that the
officer was an Atheist: “If he be
only an Atheist,” replied the prince,
“that is another affair, and I have
nothing to say to it.” This answer,
which some have wanted to
turn into ridicule, was however extremely
wise: the prince, as head of
the state, has nothing to fear from
an Atheist, who is silent, and dogmatizes
not. Such a wretch, while
extremely culpable in the eyes of God
and of reason, is hurtful only to himself,
and not to others: the party-man,
the disputant, disturbs society
by his idle controversies. In this case
that law of Solon prevails not, by
which all who took not some side in
the troubles of the state were declared
infamous. That great legislator was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
too knowing to rank in this number
the controversies concerning religion,
so ill calculated to interest
good subjects; he would rather have
made it an honour to shun and to
despise them.</p>

<p>Our gloomy theological quarrels
confine not to the limits of the
kingdom the injury and hurt they do
us: they debase, in the eyes of Europe,
our nation, already too much
humiliated by her misfortunes: they
make strangers, and even the Italians,
say, “that the French know not
how to be warm, excepting for
billets of confession, or for buffoons,
for the bull Unigenitus, or
for the comick opera<a name="FNanchor_20_20"
id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.” Such is
the very unjust idea which a handfull
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of fanaticks give to all Europe of
the French nation, at a time nevertheless
when the truely estimable
part of that nation are more enlightened
than ever, more taken up about
useful objects, and fuller of contempt
for the follies and the men that disgrace
it.</p>

<p>It is not only the honour of France
which is interested in the annihilation
of these vain disputes; the honour
of religion is still more concerned
in it, on account of the obstacles
which they oppose to the conversion
of unbelievers. I will suppose that
one of those men, who have had the
misfortune, in our times, to attack religion
in their writings, and against
whom the Jesuits and the Jansenists
have equally exerted themselves,
should address at the same time the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
two most intrepid theologists of each
party, and speak to them thus: “You
are right, gentlemen, to cry out
shame against me, and it is my intention
to repair it. Dictate to me
then in concert a confession of faith
proper for the purpose, and which
may reconcile me first with God,
and afterwards with every one of
you.” On the very first article of the
creed, “I believe in God the Father
Almighty,” he would infallibly set
by the ears the two Catechists, by
asking them if God is equally powerful
over the heart and over the body?
“Without doubt,” the Jansenist
would aver: “Not quite so,” the Jesuit
would mutter. “You are a
blasphemer,” the former would
cry; “And you,” would reply the
second, “a destroyer of the freedom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and the merit of good works.”
Both addressing themselves afterward
to their proselyte, would say to him,
“Ah, Sir, infidelity is still better
than the abominable doctrine of
my adversary: beware of confiding
your soul to such bad hands. If
the blind,” says the Gospel, “lead
the blind, they will both fall into
the ditch.” It must be owned,
that the blind infidel would find himself
a little embarrassed between two
men, who offer each to serve him as
guide, and yet mutually charge each
other with being blinder than him.
“Gentlemen,” would he say to them,
without doubt, “I thank you both
for your charitable offers: God has
given me, to conduct me in the
dark, a staff, which is reason, and
which you say will lead me to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
faith: well, I will make use of
this salutary staff, and I will draw
from it more utility than from you
two.”</p>

<p>Nothing more remains then to government
and the magistrates, for
the honour of religion and the state,
than to repress, and render alike contemptible,
both parties. We say it
with so much the more confidence,
as nobody calls in doubt the impartiality
of the wise depositaries of justice,
and the hearty contempt which
they have for these absurd contests,
the dangerous effects of which their
office has required them to prevent.
With what satisfaction will wise and
enlightened subjects see them complete
their work? Ought not the
Jansenist Gazetteer and the
Convulsionaries<a name="FNanchor_21_21"
id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to expect from them, on
the first occasion, the same treatment
as the Jesuits; with this difference,
however, which we are to put (in
point of honour) between the punishment
of a revolted noblesse, and that
of a turbulent populace? The Jesuits
uttered their dangerous maxims in
open day: the Convulsionaries and
the Jansenist Gazetteer preach and
print their extravagancies in the dark.
The obscurity alone with which these
wretches envelope themselves, can
shield them from the fate which they
merit: perhaps also there needs to
destroy them only to drag them out of
that obscurity, only to order the Convulsionaries
(under pain of whipping)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
to exhibit their disgusting farces,
not in a garret, but in a fair, for
money, among dancers on the rope,
and players with cups and balls, who
will soon bring them down: and as
to the Jansenist Gazetteer (under pain
of being led through the streets upon
an ass) of printing his dull libel not
in his garret, but at an authorised
bookseller’s, at the publisher’s, for
example, of the <i>Christian Journal</i>,
so widely circulated, and so deserving
of being so. Convulsionaries and
gazetteers will vanish, the moment
in which they shall have lost the little
merit which remains to them, that
of <i>clandestineness</i>. In a very short
time the name of the Jansenists will
be forgotten, as that of their adversaries
is proscribed; the destruction
of the one, and the disappearance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the others, will leave no longer any
trace to recollect them by: this
event, like those which have preceded
it, will be effaced and buried
by those which shall follow; and
nothing at most will remain of it
but that French witticism, that the
chief of the Jesuits is a broken captain,
who has lost his company.</p>

<p>To conclude, we shall observe
that the title of <i>Society of Jesus</i> is still
one of the reproaches which the Jansenists
cast on the Jesuits, as a too
proud denomination; by which they
seemed to attribute to themselves
alone the quality of Christians: this
is a pretty slight subject of quarrel,
and proves only what we have already
said, that hatred has formed
weapons of every thing to attack
them. The true crime of the society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
we cannot repeat it too often, is not
the being called the <i>Company of Jesus</i>,
but the having been really a company
of intriguers and fanaticks; the having
endeavoured to oppress every
thing which gave it umbrage; the
having wanted to domineer in every
thing; the having intermeddled in all
affairs and all factions; the having
sought, in a word, rather to render
themselves necessary than useful.</p>

<p>The spirit of giddiness, which has
occasioned the misfortune of the Jesuits
in France, seems to announce
to them a like fate in the rest of Europe.
They have long been cried
down in the territories of the king
of Sardinia, and the republick of
Venice; and the little existence they
yet preserve there, may very possibly
be shaken anew by the shocks which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
they have just felt elsewhere: their
conduct in Silesia, during the last
war, has not disposed favourably towards
them a prince, in other respects
an enemy to superstition and the
monkish race: the house of Austria,
which has so long protected them,
begins to be tired of them, and to
find out what they are; and they
have all room to fear, lest the bomb,
which has burst in Portugal and in
France, should dart some of its splinters
against them into all parts of
Europe.</p>

We know from a very respectable and very sure
hand, that this father of the church was some
months since at Petersbourg, where he wrote, for
bread, panegyricks on a great princess, who pays
to his eulogies the same regard as to his writings.
Nothing more was wanting to the disgrace of
those who set him to work, but to leave him, as
they do, in want, and obliged to go to beg abjectly,
at six hundred leagues, his subsistence.</p></div>

The reader, perhaps, will not be displeased
to see what a philosopher of much wit, and full
of contempt besides for all theological quarrels,
thought of this charming doctrine. “Can it be
possible to give to the word <i>freedom</i> a meaning
so forced as that which the Jansenists give it?
We are now, according to them, like a ball on
a billiard-table, indifferent whether it move to
the right or to the left; but at the very time
that it moves to the right, it is maintained to
be still indifferent as to its moving to that side;
for this reason, that it might have been driven to
the left. Such is what they have the presumption
to call in us <i>freedom</i>; a freedom purely passive,
which signifies only the different use which
the Creator may make of our wills, and not
the use which we can make of them ourselves
without his help. What fantastic and fallacious
language!” <i>Lettre de Mr. de la Motte, à Mr. de
Fenelon.</i></p></div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
